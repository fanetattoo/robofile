1
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,277
(thunder booming)

2
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,721
(cave crumbling)

3
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,891
(wolf howling)

4
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:25,927
(ominous music)

5
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,442
(airplane swooshing)

6
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:14,174
(suitcase rattles)

7
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,156
- (sighs) Fuck.

8
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:37,031
(car swooshing)

9
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,168
(brakes squeak)

10
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,749
- Where to?

11
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,352
- Traveling, easy to lose stuff.

12
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,454
- You don't know where
you're going?

13
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,457
- Patience usually pays off.

14
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,193
Here.

15
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,567
(eerie music)

16
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,335
Is there a problem?

17
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,939
- No, no it's,
it's just a long ride.

18
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,841
I was just signing off.

19
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,442
(Luke sighs)

20
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,382
- Yeah, you're seeing the light.

21
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,317
Here.

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,254
- Okay, but when we get there
you get out.

23
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,257
You don't fuck around.
You get out.

24
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,665
(taxi rumbling)

25
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:48,970
(thunder booming)

26
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,877
(rain tapping)

27
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,613
(uneasy music)

28
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:09,189
(couple moaning and panting)

29
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,928
Hey. Hey, mister.

30
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,664
Your destination. We're here.

31
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,733
Come on!

32
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,568
- Alright, old man.

33
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,502
Fuck.

34
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:56,971
Here.

35
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:57,839
Keep the change.

36
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:58,906
- Out.

37
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,042
- I'm sure here in Bumfuck
it goes a long way, huh?

38
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,009
- Get out!

39
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:03,778
Out! Out! (indistinct)

40
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,079
- Alright! Fuck!

41
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,914
Motherfucker!

42
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,149
(thunder booming)

43
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,984
(taxi rumbling)

44
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,720
(rain tapping)

45
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:17,158
(thunder booming)

46
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,365
(footsteps splash)

47
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,463
(gate clanking)

48
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,886
(eerie music)

49
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,760
(lighter clicks)

50
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,694
Hello?

51
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,677
What the fuck?

52
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,851
(lighter clicks)

53
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,165
Fuck!

54
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,335
(sinister music)

55
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,704
- A lovely pring you did.

56
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,405
- I don't understand.

57
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,211
- So, I guess you're the one.

58
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,646
- The one what?

59
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:24,051
(Klaatu laughs)

60
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,921
(sinister music)

61
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,802
- Oh, you've got to be
shitting me.

62
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:47,208
(uneasy music)

63
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,813
(ominous music)

64
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,601
(doors creaking)

65
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:35,256
(Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

66
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,160
- I don't understand you.

67
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,929
(uneasy music)

68
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:07,221
(Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

69
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,891
- He says you're like a lamb
to slaughter.

70
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:17,465
- Oh my God, let him
in. He is soaking wet!

71
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,201
Please get him a towel.

72
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,738
(Klaatu laughs)

73
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,644
I know, creepy right?

74
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,813
- Yeah.

75
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,415
- You are?

76
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,617
- Luke Matthews.

77
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,055
- Your towel.

78
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,557
Dinner will be served
promptly at eight.

79
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,459
Do not be late.

80
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,462
- Hey, wait.

81
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,031
Goddammit.

82
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,532
Excuse me.

83
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,067
Fuck,

84
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,835
- So you too?

85
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,237
- What?

86
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,705
Sorry, yeah.

87
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,340
I received an unmarked envelope

88
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,542
and a one way plane ticket and-

89
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,845
- an impossible
quantum/bio-quantum equation

90
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,516
that could change life as
we know it?

91
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,850
- Well yes.

92
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,590
And you are?

93
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,692
- Ivanna Escalante.

94
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,230
Don't judge a book by
its cover, smart guy.

95
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:27,234
Beneath this exterior beats
the heart of a rationalist.

96
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,472
My graduate dissertation
is on quantum mechanics.

97
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:34,975
- And who was that?

98
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,210
The staff?

99
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,144
- I guess.

100
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,646
I don't really know.

101
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,648
The rest of us got in
earlier this afternoon.

102
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,217
- Hello.

103
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:49,390
(sighs) My name is
Sophia Sokolova,

104
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,059
but please call me Sophie.

105
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,328
- Luke Matthews.

106
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,464
Russian?

107
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:58,699
- Yes, you are correct.

108
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:00,835
- It's nice to meet you.

109
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,270
So are you an aspiring
physicist as well?

110
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:07,274
- No, I'm not really aspiring
to anything.

111
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:12,813
I am-- well was a medical
student.

112
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:16,617
Of sorts. Hard to explain.

113
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,686
- And?

114
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,855
Go on, tell him.

115
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,924
This is fucking cool.

116
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:29,430
- I suppose what you would
call me is an empath.

117
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:36,505
- An empath, you mean like
a psychic or medium?

118
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,038
- You might say that.

119
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:38,973
- Gloves?

120
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:44,178
- That's protection.

121
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:49,150
- So, uh, what so you
say we show you around,

122
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:52,386
introduce you to Brad and you
can freshen up before dinner?

123
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,888
- That sounds good.

124
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,190
I just need to find a bathroom.

125
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,324
- Of course.

126
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,294
Around the corner, on the left.

127
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,531
- Got it.

128
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:11,540
- Another scientist?
He seems nice.

129
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,807
- I hope so.

130
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,177
- What do you mean?

131
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:22,216
- I don't know;
something seems weird.

132
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:25,486
Sorry, Ivanna -- never mind.

133
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,523
- One of your premonitions?

134
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,994
- I sense --desperation.

135
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,132
Someone running away from
something.

136
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:43,804
Someone with something to hide.

137
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:47,509
- And you're getting that
from the ether?

138
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,691
(thunder cracks)

139
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:17,037
- [Luke] This is something
else huh?

140
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,939
- We haven't had much time
to explore,

141
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:23,210
but yes,
I'd say "something else"
is an adequate description.

142
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,778
- Is "it" here?

143
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:25,846
Have you seen it?

144
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,914
- It's safe.

145
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:27,948
- [Brad] You sure?

146
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,284
- Yes, come and meet Luke.

147
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,591
- I never should have come.

148
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,826
- Brad, this is Luke.

149
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,596
- Luke Matthews.
It's nice to meet you

150
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,297
- That motherfucker is
not right.

151
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,735
I am telling you that
he isn't right and
(unintelligible)

152
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,309
- Yeah, well,
an associate professor

153
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:59,380
of physics and quantum mechanics
at Miskatonic University.

154
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:04,918
- Ah yes. Myself,
the pharmaceutical sciences.

155
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,789
So what did you make of
that invitation?

156
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,525
- I'm not sure really.

157
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:13,927
It's fascinating, it's
curiosity-inspiring.

158
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,599
But of course it's improbable.

159
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,300
- I must say I disagree.

160
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,503
- Really?
'cause you always disa-

161
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,772
(glass shatters)

162
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:24,938
- What was that?

163
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,942
(ominous music)

164
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,151
- [Ivanna] Are you okay?

165
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,452
What is it?

166
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,489
- I don't know, I felt a
surge of psionic energy

167
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,793
just as I heard the crash.

168
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,027
I still feel it.

169
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,962
- Do you expect me to
believe in the impossible?

170
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,431
- Believe what you want,

171
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,299
but didn't you just fly
halfway around the world

172
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,336
to investigate something you
claim to be "impossible"?

173
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,707
- What is this?

174
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,875
- This? It was not us.

175
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,844
- (Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

176
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,814
- We can clean it if you want.

177
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:12,654
- NO! Dinner will be served
shortly and your honored host
does not tolerate tardiness.

178
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,322
- (together) Understand?

179
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:19,893
- Great effort, many were
expended to greet you

180
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,263
all here for this momentous
occasion.

181
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:26,266
Now, if you please.

182
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,107
Chop, chop!

183
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:49,824
(glass clinking)

184
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,441
- Chop, chop.

185
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,210
(Klaatu laughs)

186
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,618
- This is me.

187
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:18,018
I just need a moment.

188
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,622
- And I am across the hall here.

189
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,489
I will meet you guys downstairs.

190
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,629
- I do prefer a little privacy

191
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,496
so I took a room
on the other end.

192
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,867
There's plenty to choose from.

193
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:35,904
Do you smoke?

194
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,806
- Cigarettes? No thanks.

195
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,775
- Not cigarettes. Cannabis?

196
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,811
- I don't mean just to get high.

197
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:45,279
I mean I use it as a tool

198
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,982
to help unfocus my
social anxiety.

199
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,620
- You know it's funny,
sometimes the herb mellows
out you fear

200
00:15:52,654 --> 00:15:53,655
and then other times -

201
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,189
- she kicks your ass.

202
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:58,660
- Yeah,
I could use some of that.

203
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:10,137
(Luke coughs)

204
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:17,344
- This is a special
cush, really nice dreams.

205
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,080
- Muchos Gracias Senor.

206
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,735
- Ass kicked already.

207
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,441
- Cool.

208
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,846
Wow, strong shit.

209
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:55,783
(thunder cracks)

210
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,418
(door creaks)

211
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,592
(thunder cracks)

212
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,896
- Weird.

213
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,837
The fuck was I doing?

214
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,337
Hmm.

215
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,462
Fuck me.

216
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,415
(melancholy music)

217
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:34,882
(knocking on door)

218
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,818
- [Ivanna] Hey, Sophie.
You ready?

219
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,921
- (under her breath) Of
course, you dumb bitch.

220
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:54,035
(ominous music)

221
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,012
(gong resinates)

222
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,648
- Please be seated.

223
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:20,728
- Oh

224
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,132
- I say we eac-

225
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,199
- SILENCE!

226
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:30,038
Ladies, gentlemen,
distinguished guests.

227
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:34,241
I present Dr. Richard Cernovich.

228
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:37,045
(bangs gong)

229
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,748
- Call me Cerno.

230
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,052
Klaatu, attend me.

231
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:48,656
(Klaatu laughs)

232
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,257
- Ice cold.

233
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,326
(liquid pouring)

234
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,242
- Heaven Klaatu.

235
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:14,182
Well, I hope you have all
found the accommodations

236
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,883
to your liking?

237
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,220
- Cernovich? ...Cernovich?

238
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,255
- I know that name.

239
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,526
- [Cerno] The devil you do.

240
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,197
- A colleague of mine, turned
me on to some research papers

241
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:34,434
written by a
Professor Richard Cernovich.

242
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:38,840
The man was a genius.

243
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:43,611
A pioneer in neuropsychiatry,
theoretical physics

244
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:47,247
and an innovator in
the field of quantum biology.

245
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,550
- That same Cernovich was
banished from academia

246
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,185
and exiled from
the United States

247
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:55,455
for unethical human
experimentation in 1973.

248
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,525
All records from his
mind-mapping sub-project

249
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,096
were destroyed and it's very
existence classified Top Secret.

250
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,431
- The Cernovich Horrors?

251
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:08,335
- So you're the Manchurian
Candidate guy.

252
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,638
- Long time ago.

253
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,740
- A lot of dead people
because of you.

254
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:15,943
- Murder, mutilation,
genocides, slavery,

255
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:18,813
all have been perpetuated
under frameworks that said they

256
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:20,915
were lawful and legal,

257
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:24,152
as long as you abided
by the regulations.

258
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:28,388
- Trauma based mind control,
MK Ultra, Project Parrot,

259
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,490
Project Doll.

260
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:35,530
Experimenting on human
populations, LSD,

261
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,668
behavioral control of
entire cultures.

262
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:44,071
- That wasn't my program
but I did take it over, yes.

263
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:49,177
My son heads it up now,
or what's left of it.

264
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,311
All above board and legal.

265
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:55,016
As you said yourself,
Mr. Matthews,

266
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,417
I was an innovator, a scientist.

267
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,588
A respected member of
the academic community

268
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:04,324
until a moment of political
cowardice.

269
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:09,429
Literally overnight I became
a disgrace, a criminal,

270
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:14,569
but not without a code
of conduct.

271
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:19,140
Klaatu,

272
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,175
siticulosus.

273
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,428
Thank you Klaatu.

274
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:45,398
Well enough about me.

275
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,202
Let's go around
the horn shall we,

276
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,571
and really get acquainted.

277
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,943
Brad Richards, born in Zaria,
Nigeria.

278
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:59,614
A pharmaceutical scientist,
mathematician and chemist

279
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:02,750
hailing from
Kings College London.

280
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,484
His main research
interests are in

281
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:08,689
the areas of breathable gases,
anesthesia.

282
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:12,727
As well as the development of
designer recreational drugs

283
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,198
with particular emphasis
on ecstasy.

284
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:19,934
- No.

285
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,302
- [Cerno] The local tabloids
dubbed him

286
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:24,672
"The Pied Piper of Manchester."

287
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:28,075
His designer pills would
lure thousands of teenagers

288
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:29,543
to massive rave parties,

289
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:33,381
until one fateful night
last September.

290
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:37,484
When some 250 teenagers died.

291
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,791
Thanks to a young hot shot
city barrister

292
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:46,527
Brad was acquitted on a
technicality.

293
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,964
Narrowly escaping an angry
mob of grieving parents,

294
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,334
Brad slipped out of the
country in the dead of night,

295
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:57,705
not to be seen again, until now.

296
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:00,141
- Not true.

297
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,709
- Oh, but it is.

298
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,980
Feeling a little anxious are we?

299
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:10,450
- It, first of all,
it wasn't my fault.

300
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,386
- Relax, Mr. Richards.

301
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,454
No need to explain.

302
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,991
You're among friends here.

303
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,693
We understand your
social phobias.

304
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:20,628
- So do you have a file on
each of us?

305
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,496
- The man always has a file.

306
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:29,737
- A first-generation US
citizen of Argentinian descent,

307
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,774
and the first in her
family to attend college.

308
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,077
Ivanna earned her Bachelor's
of Science in Physics

309
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:42,383
from the University of
California San Diego in 2015,

310
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,652
graduating at the top of
her class.

311
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,020
She was awarded

312
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:50,524
the Physical Sciences Dean's
Undergraduate Award for
Excellence.

313
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,462
In addition the Dean also
awarded her

314
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,398
with a scandalous affair.

315
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,402
- We would have broken all
the barriers.

316
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:02,670
You and me.

317
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:08,209
- Yes, you're very fond
of loyalty, aren't you.

318
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:12,613
You have nothing to
fear from me.

319
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:16,484
I am loyal to those who
deserve it.

320
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,823
Sophie Sokolov.

321
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,726
You have been obsessed with
NDE phenomena

322
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,195
ever since the tragic
loss of your twin sister

323
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,698
at the tender age of eleven.

324
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:34,268
However it was this
tragedy that awakened your

325
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,970
special "gift".

326
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:39,073
Sophie was recently
dismissed from her residency

327
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:42,676
at Novosibirsk State Medical
University.

328
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,746
Seems she fell in with a
small group

329
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,418
of students conducting
clandestine experiments

330
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:53,954
to produce near-death
experiences.

331
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,160
Unable to prove which one
of the suspects administered

332
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:02,196
the drug that stopped
the victim's heart,

333
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,734
the case was thrown out
and the charges dismissed.

334
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,703
- Kapstein knew the risk.

335
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:13,474
- If I'm not mistaken
poor Mr. Kapstein ran

336
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:16,077
into problems in Syracuse.

337
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,714
Apparently, he was worse
than you with volunteers.

338
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,050
(slight laugh)

339
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:28,122
You killed Hank Jones, who
gave the injection to Kapstein.

340
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,125
You are nothing if not
prodigious.

341
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,262
Jabbed that sucker right
into his neck.

342
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:40,701
Fired dose after dose into
him, popped the carotid artery.

343
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,137
And they say the blood is still

344
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,141
in the cracks of the floor
and under the cabinets.

345
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,410
Impressive.

346
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,180
- You're enjoying this.

347
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:57,351
- I have to hand it to you,
Sophie, you got away with it.

348
00:26:57,384 --> 00:27:01,822
Simply disappeared to
the UK as a new resident,

349
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:07,962
outside the purview of our
mutual friend, Inspector Tanaka.

350
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:11,165
- You're a blackmailer in
the spirit.

351
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:15,336
- Nothing so harsh,
Sophie. An offer.

352
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:18,672
(bangs table)

353
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,741
- You don't need to say it.

354
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:23,677
I did it!

355
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,185
I killed my fiancé.

356
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,189
I didn't mean to.

357
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,093
- [Cerno] Oh but you did.

358
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:52,206
- Yes.

359
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:58,580
- No worries Luke,
Honorem latrones.

360
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:02,082
- Latin.
"There is honor among thieves."

361
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:04,985
- I think what he
means to say is

362
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,622
that he thinks he can trust us.

363
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,456
- With what?

364
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:11,959
Why the security?

365
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:13,894
Paranoia?

366
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:19,900
- Each one of you have been
searching for the same thing,

367
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:22,870
albeit for different reasons.

368
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:27,642
A way to breach
the Quantum Barrier.

369
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:32,846
- The key to the manipulation
of time is control of space.

370
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,250
Perhaps, the answer to
the mystery of the afterlife

371
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:38,485
is in death.

372
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,223
What happens when we die?

373
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:46,661
Is it like Buddha said,
a candle blowing out.

374
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,997
One cannot say where
the flame went.

375
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:54,768
- What do you think is
out there?

376
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:00,874
- Creation itself.

377
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,010
Obviously, it doesn't come from

378
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:05,045
what has already been created,

379
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,748
from the world we live in.

380
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:10,685
So it must be there.

381
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:15,222
Coming from what is darkness
to us now.

382
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:20,794
Sophie, you see beings
from there as they enter

383
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,732
into our space, yes.

384
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,667
- Yes.

385
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:30,337
- Now just imagine going there,

386
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:32,172
in the same way.

387
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:35,442
Except with all aspects
of control and purpose.

388
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:41,915
Not for a flash of an instant
with DMT or LSD or meditation,

389
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:47,454
but as a sentient being.

390
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,825
Capable of everything.

391
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:01,569
Let's get down to business
shall we?

392
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:02,836
Klaatu.

393
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,907
(Klaatu bangs gong)

394
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:11,912
- Mein ibento o hikidasu.

395
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:18,919
- My friends, I give you
the greatest quantum
breakthrough

396
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:22,022
of the last 200 years,

397
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,729
Quantamine.

398
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,897
- There is a risk.

399
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,398
- This is not from a
human source.

400
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:34,868
- So if I may ask,
Professor, where is it from?

401
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,403
- Fuck.

402
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:38,540
- It's very existence
defies the laws of nature.

403
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:41,275
- It comes from them. And
you don't fuck with them.

404
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:43,010
- As it should be with
a substance

405
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:45,913
that can rearrange every
molecule in and around your body

406
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,182
instantaneously upon contact.

407
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:51,452
- I believe that within
each one of you

408
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:55,657
lies a piece of the key to
breaching the quantum barrier.

409
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,526
We have known this was
possible on a quantum level

410
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,461
for some time now.

411
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:03,631
Theorem with protons,
magnetic fields, lasers,

412
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,866
sonic resonance.

413
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:11,305
What was missing was
the biomechanical component,

414
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,541
the quantamine and--

415
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:14,676
- The soul.

416
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,111
- The psychic component.
Control.

417
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,714
- The nexus, perhaps.

418
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:20,981
- Dangerous.

419
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,650
- Illegal.

420
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,722
- Now, I have a crude but
sufficient lab

421
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:30,592
set up here in the house.

422
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,695
Would any of you care
to join me?

423
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,600
(lightswitch flicks)

424
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,334
- This way please.

425
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,436
Mind your step!

426
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,274
The Quantum Chamber!

427
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,844
- What the--

428
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:53,782
- Yeah man! We all owe you a
thanks, in advance, friends.

429
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:56,984
- Slow down. The dead, huh?

430
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,720
- You worried, young man?

431
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:00,588
- Don't be troubled, Luke.

432
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,489
Your soul is beautiful.

433
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:03,490
- What about mine?

434
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:04,358
- I don't think--

435
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,059
- Quiet now!

436
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:18,673
- I see,
you are using tuning forks

437
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,441
to generate a frequency

438
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:21,375
- Very good.

439
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:25,212
- To synchronize the proton
waves within this chamber.

440
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,381
- How did you determine
the correct frequency?

441
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:30,652
- I haven't, yet. But
now that you are here.

442
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,723
- Did you actually achieve
a stable atomization
of the quantamine into vapor?

443
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,257
- We did indeed.

444
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,460
However the liquid form
of the quantamine seems

445
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:42,963
to dissolve the skin tissue
upon contact.

446
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,233
- Sophie, what is it?

447
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:52,640
- I sense darkness, a presence.

448
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:54,876
- Perhaps you are sensing
the recent loss of life

449
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,511
in this very room.

450
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:57,679
- Loss of life?

451
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,147
- Yes, Dr. Wallace
Keith, a dear old friend

452
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,951
and long time colleague
was rather careless during

453
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:06,654
our last attempt to breach
the barrier -- and it cost us.

454
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:08,857
- It cost him.

455
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:12,560
- For me, the use of my legs.

456
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:15,663
For Wallace, his life.

457
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:17,932
- A word

458
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:21,368
(Klaatu whispering)

459
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,540
- I am afraid I have an
urgent matter

460
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,909
requiring my immediate
attention.

461
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:30,477
I must leave for Geneva at once.

462
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:34,081
I shall not be more than a
day or two.

463
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:36,283
- What about us?

464
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:38,887
What do you want us to do then?

465
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:43,725
- Please, by all means proceed,
my dear.

466
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:45,627
Everything that happens
in this lab

467
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,428
is automatically documented
and recorded

468
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:51,231
on a secure server here
in the house.

469
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:55,168
I expect you lot can pick
up where we left off.

470
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:59,373
- What's in it for us Cerno?

471
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,777
- What is it that you want Mr.
Matthews?

472
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:05,245
Credit, Fame?

473
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:08,048
How about a a Nobel prize?

474
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,117
I know without a doubt,

475
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,819
each one of you would
complete this experiment.

476
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:17,291
If for no other reason then
to satisfy your own curiosity.

477
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,197
$500,000 each.

478
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:27,167
Enough to start over.

479
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,038
A fresh start, a new name.

480
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,440
Freedom from the past.

481
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:35,075
What say you?

482
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:36,044
- Done.

483
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,145
- Yes, I agree.

484
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,683
- Yes, yes of course.

485
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,450
- Excellent.

486
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:46,988
Fortune favors the bold
my friends.

487
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:50,223
Alea jacta est.

488
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,870
(thunder crashes)

489
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:08,776
(rain falls)

490
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:13,047
(ominous music)

491
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:26,060
(button buzzes)

492
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:42,442
- All right, how do we ingest
a drug that we can't touch

493
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,178
because it literally eats flesh?

494
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:47,915
- I don't believe it is
eating the flesh.

495
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,585
I believe the quantamine is
instantaneously breaching

496
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:53,755
the barrier between this
dimension and the next.

497
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:56,057
- You mean that the parts of
the body in direct contact

498
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,493
with the liquid are still
there, here?

499
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:03,131
You know what I mean,
but in another dimension?

500
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:05,332
- Basic, but yeah.

501
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,002
- Yes, basic, like you.

502
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,037
- You wish.

503
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,507
- Hey, can we not. Please?

504
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:18,478
- Okay. No one could survive
that state of dual separation.

505
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:26,821
What we have to do is balance
the quantum entanglement.

506
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,557
- Please, go on.

507
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:34,428
- Perhaps simultaneously
immersing the body in some type

508
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:36,964
of quantamine based
saline solution

509
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:38,498
at the same time of injection?

510
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,134
- No, we do not have
enough quantamine for that,

511
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:41,234
nor any type of float
tank big enough

512
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,970
to accommodate even one of us.

513
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:46,607
But, according to these notes,

514
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,712
Cerno and his colleague
they were almost there.

515
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:54,015
Here. Look at this.

516
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:57,217
- Ah! I see.

517
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,954
So, what if when I change
the state of the quantamine

518
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:02,990
from it's liquid form,
to the atmospheric gas.

519
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:05,860
We also generate a more
refined breathable gas?

520
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,262
Which I can dilute with a
solution to allow the body

521
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:11,933
enough time to achieve
superposition.

522
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,500
- Yes!

523
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,737
A critical balance between
the internal

524
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,272
and external exposure to
the quantamine,

525
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:21,008
all at a controlled rate.

526
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:24,444
- OK, all right. With your help
I can rig these tuning forks

527
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:26,480
to generate a frequency,

528
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:30,484
a constant 432 Hz which
should synchronize the proton

529
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,019
within the chamber with
the atomization of

530
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:34,622
the quantamine gas.

531
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:35,923
- I'm your girl.

532
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:37,992
- And, according to
Cerno's notes,

533
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:43,765
this 'thing' will amplify my
psionic abilities and link us,

534
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:45,465
our consciousness.

535
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,469
This will allow me to
act as a 'mental anchor.'

536
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:57,812
- Guys, I think this is
going to work.

537
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:01,249
(ominous music)

538
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:07,188
(metal door creaks)

539
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,607
- Klaatu! Klaatu!

540
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:35,216
I expect everything is
proceeding according to my plan?

541
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,285
- Flawlessly, Sir.

542
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:41,823
- Good. Let us begin, shall we?

543
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:54,035
(air hissing)

544
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:57,972
(door creaking)

545
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:01,742
(ominous music)

546
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:30,805
(door creaks and closes)

547
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,247
- Are you ready sir?

548
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,283
- Age quod agis!

549
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,257
(air hissing)

550
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,827
(dramatic music)

551
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:57,131
(keys typing)

552
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:01,736
(machine whirring)

553
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,960
- Come, come, come.

554
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:02,163
Slow, slow.

555
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:27,655
(knobs click)

556
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:43,437
(beds creaking)

557
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:10,965
- All right. Anyone want out?

558
00:42:11,132 --> 00:42:12,833
Last chance.

559
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:15,836
No?

560
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,174
All right sound off as I
count us down.

561
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:23,210
- 1st position, go.

562
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:27,281
(air hissing)

563
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,518
- 2nd position, go.

564
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,885
(tuning forks ringing)

565
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:39,060
- Mind linking: 3, 2 -- 1.

566
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:47,568
- Command position in 3, 2, 1.

567
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:52,606
(electricity buzzing)

568
00:42:57,445 --> 00:43:00,614
- (Sophie screams)

569
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:07,588
(ominous music)

570
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:26,508
(thunder crashes)

571
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,178
(water sloshes)

572
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:37,918
(dramatic music)

573
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:53,194
(Luke panting)

574
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:49,149
- What happened?

575
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,586
- I'm a little hazy me-self.

576
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:55,189
- I just woke up on
the bathroom floor?

577
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,891
I don't remember--

578
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:01,630
- What the hell happened?

579
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:02,963
- Shouldn't you know?

580
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,601
- What did you assholes
do to me?

581
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:08,102
- I could say the same.

582
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:10,871
- Hey, hey, we're all a
little concerned about

583
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:13,708
how exactly things what
went down last night.

584
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:15,409
We all need to calm down.

585
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,244
- What? Did you all lure me
into a trap or what something?

586
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:19,179
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can
sod off with that rubbish!

587
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:21,048
- Who lured you into a trap?

588
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,816
What the fuck are you
talking about?

589
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,917
- I could ask you the same.

590
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,320
- Why can't I shine?

591
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:28,723
It's a blank since the lab.

592
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:30,991
- [Ivanna] When has that
ever happened?

593
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:33,394
- Something is heavy.

594
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:38,566
A block,
some sort of physic barrier.

595
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:40,735
- The Lab!

596
00:46:41,603 --> 00:46:43,370
The cameras!

597
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:47,474
- FUCK!!!

598
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:48,475
The Quantamine is gone.

599
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,476
- [Brad] The fuck?

600
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:50,844
- [Sophie] What is it?
- Check the computer.

601
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:52,012
Do we have video?

602
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:53,748
Anything?

603
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:54,248
(keys typing)

604
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:55,750
Move.

605
00:46:58,753 --> 00:47:00,187
What'd you do?

606
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:02,524
- Did you try the back up?

607
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:03,857
- That is the back-up.

608
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:12,166
The gas system is fucked.

609
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,934
- What about the scanners?

610
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:16,236
The paper readouts?

611
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,171
- Uh,

612
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,543
it's, it's gone,

613
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:24,211
everything from the breach
point is gone.

614
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:25,647
Sophie, you're our meta link.

615
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,682
- I have nothing but a
splitting headache?

616
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:29,316
- Of course 'cause
fucking useless.

617
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,984
- (in Russian) Yob tvoyu mat!

618
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,721
- Hey! Hey, hey-- come on guys.

619
00:47:32,754 --> 00:47:34,021
That is not going to help us.

620
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,090
- I'm sorry, I just--

621
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:39,393
- I don't know about the rest
of you but I am so thirsty.

622
00:47:39,426 --> 00:47:40,994
We need a break.

623
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,231
Let's get some coffee,
catch our breath,

624
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:45,633
then we will sort this all out?

625
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:49,504
- Yeah, I need some smoke.

626
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,947
- Sorry.

627
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,319
(sad music)

628
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,262
- You can't really live
with what happened,

629
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:18,566
because you feel so deeply,

630
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,235
so much guilt.

631
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:24,004
It's delicious.
Watching you struggle.

632
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,273
- What the fuck.

633
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:28,710
- How can you live
with yourself?

634
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:31,211
With what you did?

635
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,881
- What the fuck is this?

636
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,716
- What the fuck is this?

637
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:37,351
(keys typing)

638
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:43,257
- [Sophie And Katia] GUYS!
Guys come back here and--

639
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,861
(dramatic music)

640
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:50,197
(television static)

641
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:12,386
- [Sophie And Katia] Ouch!

642
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:15,322
What the fucking fuck stop!

643
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:20,862
Now listen here you fucking stop

644
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,231
and I mean right fucking now you

645
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:28,035
Zacroy svoy peesavati
rot, sooka.

646
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:34,074
(Sophie screams)

647
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:47,187
- It's okay, can you hear me?

648
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:49,022
- Here let me help.

649
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:52,694
All right I got a pulse.

650
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:54,729
Let's get her downstairs.

651
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:55,763
(all grunting)

652
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:57,565
- Got her? Got her?

653
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,301
Here take her, take her, watch
her head, watch her head.

654
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:03,838
- No

655
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:04,639
- Let me help you.

656
00:50:04,672 --> 00:50:05,607
- Don't.

657
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,541
- I'm trying to help you.

658
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:07,174
- Don't, don't touch me.

659
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:08,108
- Okay, fuck.

660
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:08,843
- [Brad] Take a hit.

661
00:50:08,877 --> 00:50:09,811
- NOOO!

662
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:13,013
(Sophie screams)

663
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:14,983
I'm so sorry.

664
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:17,050
I just have to work
through this.

665
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:19,186
I have not felt this
out of control since--

666
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,320
since my sister--

667
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,623
- Let me help you to your room,

668
00:50:21,656 --> 00:50:23,892
maybe if you just lay
down a bit,

669
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:26,193
have some quiet time
to yourself.

670
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:30,999
- Yeah, but please do
not touch me.

671
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,366
I can sense you all now.

672
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:34,301
Even without a physical
connection.

673
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,639
When you touch me,
it's too much.

674
00:50:37,672 --> 00:50:38,506
- Will these work?

675
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,675
- Yes, thank you.

676
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,514
And guys, I will be as
succinct as possible.

677
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:48,315
You ALL--

678
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:51,019
You need to go rub one out,
masturbate.

679
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,152
Play with yourself.

680
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:53,521
Do whatever it is you need to do

681
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:55,990
to ease some of this
sexual tension.

682
00:50:56,024 --> 00:50:58,526
- Ah yes,
a side effect of the quantamine.

683
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,931
- Some of you have some
really kinky fetishes.

684
00:51:02,964 --> 00:51:06,000
Definitely more than I
want to know about you.

685
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:07,367
Ever.

686
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:10,437
- Come on hon,
let's get you upstairs.

687
00:51:10,705 --> 00:51:11,639
- Yeah, thanks.

688
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:13,608
- Rub one out? Right.

689
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,710
- Maybe I'll take you up on
your offer.

690
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:16,644
- What?

691
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:18,478
- The smoke?

692
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,180
- Oh yeah.

693
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:22,784
You are more than welcome Luke.

694
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,002
- I can feel--

695
00:51:44,906 --> 00:51:46,040
- No

696
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:47,709
- I can't help it.

697
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:53,881
- I don't think we are safe.

698
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:56,483
- From Brad?

699
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:57,351
Luke?

700
00:51:57,384 --> 00:52:00,688
- No, something else.

701
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:12,066
I'm going to take a shower.

702
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:32,452
(door closes)

703
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:49,403
(water splashes)

704
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,314
(rings clang on show rod)

705
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:04,118
(sad music)

706
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,737
(ominous sound)

707
00:53:35,883 --> 00:53:38,786
(suitcase clicks)

708
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:42,890
- You are serious.

709
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:44,759
- Always.

710
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:50,698
When I was 11 years old I
scored 162 on the Mensa test.

711
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:52,432
Earning the label of
child genius

712
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:56,204
and considered to be
the smartest boy in London.

713
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:59,406
The social anxiety alone
was crippling.

714
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:02,375
- Gets you picked on a lot.

715
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,212
- Exactly.

716
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:08,049
This!

717
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,886
Sativa-dominant hybrid,

718
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:15,890
(Brad sniffs)

719
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,792
White Fire!

720
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:24,431
- Wow.

721
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:26,033
- Initially you will
find it a very uplifting

722
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:28,136
and euphoric feeling.

723
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:30,037
Then it induces a calming,

724
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:33,875
somewhat sedentary effect
as you start to come down.

725
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:37,011
This is probably due to its
significant concentrations

726
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:42,282
of Beta-Caryophyllene,
Limonene, and Alpha Humulene.

727
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:46,921
It averages at about 22-25% THC;

728
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:51,192
and it's also known to
have CBD as high as 5%.

729
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:56,264
In either case, it should
put you right to sleep,

730
00:54:56,296 --> 00:55:00,001
right after you "rub one out".

731
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,037
- On second thought, I
am going to take a pass.

732
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,338
- Suit yourself, mate.

733
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:08,075
- I appreciate the offer though.

734
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,446
- Anytime, Luke.

735
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:28,296
- [Kathy] Hey lover.

736
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:31,632
- Hello?

737
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:34,836
(ominous laughter)

738
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:40,107
(creepy music)

739
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,778
Hello?

740
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:10,071
(door shuts)

741
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:14,242
(Kathy laughs ominously)

742
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:17,044
(keys clicking)

743
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,180
- Ouch! Shit!

744
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:23,117
- (Klaatu laughing) Bitch.

745
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,020
(water splashing)

746
00:56:32,894 --> 00:56:33,794
- Biscuit.

747
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,031
Bangers.

748
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:40,635
Mash.

749
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,345
Munchies.

750
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:30,751
(ominous music)

751
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:44,131
(growling)

752
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:53,074
(Klaatu sniffing)

753
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:33,748
(growling)

754
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:38,486
(creepy music)

755
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:26,100
(water splashing)

756
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:31,238
(pounding on door)

757
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:35,609
- Ivanna?

758
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:42,950
Hey, um, I didn't mean
to come off as bitch.

759
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:44,251
You know?

760
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:45,719
- [Ivanna] I'm sorry too.

761
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:48,989
I didn't believe you at first.

762
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,491
- Ivanna?

763
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:53,594
(water splashing)

764
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,009
(Sophie screams)

765
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:11,846
- What the hell are you doing?

766
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:26,961
(ominous music)

767
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:29,096
Hello?

768
01:01:03,297 --> 01:01:04,198
Ah okay.

769
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,700
Haha.

770
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,703
What do you want?

771
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,740
You still mad at me?

772
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,075
(scoffs)

773
01:01:23,951 --> 01:01:26,854
(door rattles)

774
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:42,637
(mirror squeaks)

775
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,980
- Hello Sister,

776
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:58,752
it has been too long!

777
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,390
(mirror shatters)

778
01:02:03,424 --> 01:02:06,327
(Sophie Chocking)

779
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:22,711
(blood squirting)

780
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:25,446
(Katia laughs)

781
01:02:27,281 --> 01:02:29,250
My dear Sophie,

782
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:34,788
now you can finally have
the answers you have
searched for

783
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:38,492
all of your pathetic life!

784
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:43,732
So you want to know happened
after what you did to me?

785
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:46,867
When you murdered me?

786
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,904
Here, sister, see for yourself,
tell me.

787
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:54,341
What do you see?

788
01:02:58,245 --> 01:03:03,250
Welcome to the eternal night!

789
01:03:16,765 --> 01:03:19,133
Goodbye sister.

790
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:56,870
- No please!

791
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:59,239
Let me go!

792
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:02,276
Let me-- come back!

793
01:04:24,733 --> 01:04:27,501
(ominous music)

794
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,890
(electronic music)

795
01:06:33,561 --> 01:06:35,229
- Oh God No!

796
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:36,430
Spit the out.

797
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:38,265
It's poison.

798
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:42,469
No! Spit them out!

799
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:43,571
I made them.

800
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:44,506
No!

801
01:06:45,807 --> 01:06:46,908
Please listen to me.

802
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:48,108
Spit them out.

803
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:51,345
(electronic music)

804
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:02,089
(people growling)

805
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:10,999
(flesh ripping)

806
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:14,067
(Brad screaming)

807
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,759
- Please forgive me!

808
01:07:40,294 --> 01:07:43,665
(clothes ripping)

809
01:07:43,698 --> 01:07:46,935
(Brad screaming)

810
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:49,938
- God, please forgive me!

811
01:07:49,971 --> 01:07:51,438
Ahhhhhh.

812
01:07:55,777 --> 01:07:59,346
(Luke and Kathy moaning)

813
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:30,745
(Kathy laughing)

814
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:02,476
(fleshing squelching)

815
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:08,583
- Oh, fuck!

816
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:10,217
Oh God!

817
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,285
Oh Fuck!

818
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,420
Jesus!

819
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:18,660
Shit!

820
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:24,866
- You cocksucker!

821
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,401
I was just about to cum
for a change.

822
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:31,673
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

823
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:32,406
You're dead.

824
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:33,841
I know you're dead!

825
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,510
- I'm alive.

826
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:39,212
Here I'm very much alive.

827
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:46,888
In this "Quantum Hell" you
have unleashed,

828
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:50,792
I'm every bit as real
as you are sweetheart.

829
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:54,629
- The experiment. It failed?

830
01:09:54,662 --> 01:09:55,495
Oh God.

831
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:58,032
- Why would you think that?

832
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:04,038
- Crazy bitch.

833
01:10:04,072 --> 01:10:04,972
(banging on door)

834
01:10:05,006 --> 01:10:06,339
Brad! Brad! Wake up man.

835
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,241
Wake the fuck up.

836
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:10,044
Brad! Fuck!

837
01:10:10,078 --> 01:10:13,280
(ominous music)

838
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:18,218
- What the fuck are you
yelling about?

839
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:23,490
- Fuck.

840
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:29,864
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

841
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:32,232
(slapping face)

842
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:35,937
(speaking other language)

843
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:38,039
(creature grunting)

844
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:40,808
(Luke screams)

845
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:49,717
(ominous music)

846
01:11:08,903 --> 01:11:11,873
(thunder crashing)

847
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:18,780
- What the hell?

848
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:22,517
- Could be.

849
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:33,561
Or any one of an infinite
number of dimensions.

850
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:39,299
- Sophie, about earlier, I'm
sorry I was so aggressive.

851
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:42,804
- Do you like me?

852
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:47,508
- Yes. I do like you, Sophie.

853
01:11:55,348 --> 01:11:56,483
- Do you love me?

854
01:11:58,485 --> 01:11:59,620
- I think so.

855
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:03,024
- Do you want to finish what
you started?

856
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:08,395
(thunder crashes)

857
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:10,698
- Look out the window.

858
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:12,499
The experiment --
it must have worked.

859
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:15,736
- Of course it did,
with the help of Cerno
and my sister.

860
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,272
- Cerno?

861
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:19,406
Sister?

862
01:12:20,808 --> 01:12:22,977
- Stupid little Sophie.

863
01:12:24,377 --> 01:12:27,849
Cerno used her and
fooled you all.

864
01:12:31,252 --> 01:12:32,352
- Sophie?

865
01:12:33,754 --> 01:12:35,122
What is wrong with you?

866
01:12:35,156 --> 01:12:36,591
What are you talking about?

867
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:37,692
- For starters,

868
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:42,530
my name is not Sophie.

869
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,635
Soooopheeeee.

870
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:50,538
How pedestrian.

871
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:55,977
My name is Katia and now
for the finale.

872
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,547
I will be ending your
pathetic life.

873
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,182
It's faster if you go
with it, girl.

874
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,150
(Ivanna screams)

875
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:04,285
- Fuck you bitch!

876
01:13:04,318 --> 01:13:05,152
(lamp shatters)

877
01:13:05,186 --> 01:13:07,288
- Whooo
You go girl!

878
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,156
Give it to me baby.

879
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,992
Give it to me baby, come on.

880
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:12,326
Come one girl.

881
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,628
Whooooohoooo.

882
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:19,901
- How stupid of me to think
this is Hell.

883
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:23,237
- Hell?

884
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:24,138
- Fuck.

885
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:29,442
- I never believed in hell,
or heaven.

886
01:13:32,113 --> 01:13:34,582
I may need to reevaluate
my beliefs.

887
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:36,817
- My God!

888
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:39,452
- Look man, can we move
past this skin thing?

889
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:42,156
- Does it hurt?

890
01:13:43,391 --> 01:13:44,759
- Like a Mother Fucker!

891
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,929
Unless I am smoking this Kush.

892
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:51,065
It really seems to take
the edge off?

893
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:53,734
But is it really Kush?

894
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:56,537
Is any of this really real?

895
01:13:58,471 --> 01:13:59,974
Are you?

896
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:03,277
Maybe I shouldn't think
about it that hard,

897
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:04,512
you know what I mean?

898
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:05,680
Here man.

899
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:08,416
- No thanks.

900
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:20,928
Look man, the experiment!

901
01:14:20,962 --> 01:14:21,796
It worked.

902
01:14:21,829 --> 01:14:23,597
Do you realize where we are?

903
01:14:24,598 --> 01:14:26,734
- We've all been duped, Luke.

904
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:28,869
- We need to get down
to the lab.

905
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,838
- Already been down there.

906
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:34,875
Well, down there in regards
to this dimension down there,

907
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:38,512
back on the flip side they
are hauling off bodies.

908
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:39,981
- What?

909
01:14:40,014 --> 01:14:41,682
- Well, I guess I should
get down to it.

910
01:14:41,716 --> 01:14:42,817
- To what?

911
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:44,785
- Killing you,

912
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,389
the you here.

913
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:50,458
You, you?

914
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:52,126
You get it?

915
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:57,631
You're not very comfortable
with yourself are you?

916
01:14:57,665 --> 01:14:59,633
Things are better when you die.

917
01:15:00,468 --> 01:15:01,969
Trust me.

918
01:15:02,003 --> 01:15:02,903
Let me see?

919
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:09,210
Oh yeah!

920
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:10,845
Fuck yeah!

921
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:15,216
FUCK YEAH!

922
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:18,085
(sword whooshes)

923
01:15:19,153 --> 01:15:20,054
Luke,

924
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:21,822
Luke

925
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,861
Luke.

926
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:32,466
(Ivanna screams)

927
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,367
(Brad Scream)

928
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:34,969
(blood squelching)

929
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:38,973
- We're gonna get
the fuck out here.

930
01:15:42,076 --> 01:15:47,114
Fuck. Ivanna.

931
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:50,017
(Brad panting)

932
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,654
OOOOOOOOuchhh!

933
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:56,590
(Brad screams)

934
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:07,868
- Sophie? Katia?
Whoever the fuck you are,

935
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,538
you are a fucking cunt!

936
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,605
- Oh? You think you are upset?

937
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,809
I wanna wipe that look
off your face, mate,

938
01:16:14,842 --> 01:16:19,046
however you die here, you
are going to stay that way.

939
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,788
- Shit! Fuck!

940
01:16:27,822 --> 01:16:30,825
(Luke grunting)

941
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:54,081
(Cerno clapping)

942
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,585
- Well done!

943
01:16:57,384 --> 01:16:58,919
Well done indeed!

944
01:17:00,688 --> 01:17:02,990
I like the power of death.

945
01:17:03,023 --> 01:17:06,760
It's effective, efficiante
and most of all,

946
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:08,095
it's entertaining.

947
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:12,099
Honestly, I didn't
think you had it in you.

948
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:13,334
Bravo!

949
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:15,169
- You son of a bitch!
What did you do?

950
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:19,039
- Just fulfilling my end
of a clandestine contract.

951
01:17:22,577 --> 01:17:26,647
No wheelchair needed here
in the Quantum Realm.

952
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:28,349
- Fuck?

953
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:30,184
This--

954
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:33,721
I get it!

955
01:17:33,754 --> 01:17:35,656
- What,
you thought you could win?

956
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:40,562
My dear boy, it's not
about winning or losing.

957
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,998
It's much too deep for you
to comprehend.

958
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:47,168
- No, NO!

959
01:17:47,902 --> 01:17:49,436
You're not going to
fuck with me head Cerno.

960
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,371
I'm here.

961
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,375
I'm here.
And you're going to pay.

962
01:17:56,076 --> 01:17:58,679
- Somehow I don't think so.

963
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,184
Here, my friend,
reality is fluid.

964
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,955
Whatever you think,
therefore you are.

965
01:18:08,657 --> 01:18:12,026
Of course I have been doing
most of your thinking for you.

966
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:14,461
- Once you crossed into
this dimension,

967
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:20,000
I used Sophie's psychic link
to manifest this environment.

968
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:22,303
- You think I don't get
the simulacrum?

969
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:23,237
Me?

970
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:27,341
You think that makes you smart,
Cernovich?

971
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:30,244
- Your combined memories and
perception of this building

972
01:18:30,277 --> 01:18:34,181
manifested here in this
dimension,

973
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:37,218
all from your own minds.

974
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,254
Incredible thing to see.

975
01:18:41,556 --> 01:18:44,158
With a few tweaks of my own.

976
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:47,027
- That's right baby!

977
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:50,798
Now we'll be here,
together here forever.

978
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:52,534
Yeah.

979
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:53,100
(Kathy laughing)

980
01:18:53,133 --> 01:18:55,169
- No! No, no, no!

981
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,841
- It is quite fascinating.

982
01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:04,979
Each of you, even you,

983
01:19:06,247 --> 01:19:10,552
clinging you minds to
the reality once accupied.

984
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:14,388
If you only knew what was
possible here?

985
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:17,258
I can make it permanent.

986
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:21,929
Something you can't possibly
understand.

987
01:19:23,964 --> 01:19:28,536
Check and mate, Luke.

988
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:31,105
- Luke, you still have a
chance. Get to the lab.

989
01:19:31,138 --> 01:19:32,773
- Yeah she's right.

990
01:19:32,806 --> 01:19:35,909
If you can get back to our
dimension without dying here.

991
01:19:36,844 --> 01:19:39,514
(Brad laughs)

992
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:47,054
- (Cerno laughs)

993
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:51,526
You're all feeble
earth dwellers.

994
01:19:52,694 --> 01:19:54,428
Enjoy your fate.

995
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:57,164
(creepy music)

996
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:09,043
(all laughing)

997
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:45,379
- (gasping) This is impossible.

998
01:20:45,412 --> 01:20:48,616
- Bullocks!
Didn't he see that one coming.

999
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:52,953
- I am afraid I can not
allow you to go back, Luke.

1000
01:20:52,986 --> 01:20:53,921
- What?

1001
01:20:54,922 --> 01:20:59,093
- I currently serve a master
with very a specific appetite.

1002
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,229
You are a very sick
person, Luke.

1003
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:06,266
Those pleasures,
those wicked delights,

1004
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,803
they leave a stain on your soul.

1005
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:12,574
One my master finds quite
delectable.

1006
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:15,075
- What in the fuck are you
talking about?

1007
01:21:22,983 --> 01:21:25,085
- There is power in the blood.

1008
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:30,057
Blood, lust, sacrifice,
betrayal, murder--

1009
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,459
each one of you sinners.

1010
01:21:32,493 --> 01:21:35,162
You gave it all up for
the flesh.

1011
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:37,431
You have no protection.

1012
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:40,769
So now, once you're dead,

1013
01:21:41,703 --> 01:21:45,005
are just like food for
the master of this realm.

1014
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:47,474
Our Glorious One.

1015
01:21:48,877 --> 01:21:51,513
These Quantum Devils,

1016
01:21:52,413 --> 01:21:53,347
if you will.

1017
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:58,952
I will leave you to
your devices.

1018
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,695
I hope you find the house to
your liking,

1019
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:10,665
because you are going to be
here for a very long time.

1020
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,300
- No, I'm not dead!

1021
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:15,202
Not yet!

1022
01:22:19,774 --> 01:22:21,175
Not if I kill you first!

1023
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,178
- I see.

1024
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:28,449
Are you challenging me
to a duel?

1025
01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:30,685
- I am going to fuck you up,
asshole!

1026
01:22:30,718 --> 01:22:33,153
- Well,
I will take that as a yes!

1027
01:22:33,922 --> 01:22:35,055
Challenge accepted!

1028
01:22:35,088 --> 01:22:38,091
(snaps fingers)

1029
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,198
- Gentlemen.

1030
01:22:45,332 --> 01:22:47,968
- My dear fellow, I insist.

1031
01:22:56,243 --> 01:23:00,047
- Gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire,

1032
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,483
I will toss a coin in the air.

1033
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:06,788
As the offended party,

1034
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:08,656
it is Mr. Matthews's
choice to call the toss.

1035
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,658
Is that agreeable to
both of you?

1036
01:23:12,426 --> 01:23:14,361
What is your call, Mr. Matthews?

1037
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:16,997
- Heads.

1038
01:23:21,235 --> 01:23:22,570
- It is heads.

1039
01:23:22,604 --> 01:23:25,272
Mr. Matthews will have
the first fire.

1040
01:23:25,305 --> 01:23:27,709
Gentlemen, take your ground.

1041
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:30,945
(others clapping)

1042
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:32,079
One...

1043
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,047
two...

1044
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:35,683
three...

1045
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:36,918
four...

1046
01:23:36,951 --> 01:23:38,085
five...

1047
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:39,587
six...

1048
01:23:39,621 --> 01:23:40,855
seven...

1049
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:42,089
eight...

1050
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:43,658
nine...

1051
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:44,391
ten.

1052
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:49,631
Lord Cerno, are you ready to
receive Mr. Matthews fire?

1053
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:50,565
- Always!

1054
01:23:51,599 --> 01:23:54,368
- Mr. Matthews cock your pistol.

1055
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:57,371
(pistols fizzes)

1056
01:23:57,404 --> 01:24:01,074
(all cheer and laugh)

1057
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:05,379
- What a shame.

1058
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:07,582
His pistol must be faulty.

1059
01:24:07,615 --> 01:24:09,951
- No! No! I need another one.

1060
01:24:09,984 --> 01:24:11,218
- I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews,

1061
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,186
but you must first stand
your ground,

1062
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,523
and allow Lord Cerno his
turn to fire.

1063
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:18,860
Mr. Matthews, are you ready
to receive Lord Cerno's fire?

1064
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:20,294
- No, you gave me a bad gun.

1065
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:21,763
- You both had equal choice.

1066
01:24:21,796 --> 01:24:24,032
Is your pistol cocked,
Lord Cerno?

1067
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:25,432
- Oh yes.

1068
01:24:25,465 --> 01:24:27,267
- Then prepare to fire.

1069
01:24:27,301 --> 01:24:30,470
(foreboding music)

1070
01:24:33,373 --> 01:24:36,310
(pistol fires)

1071
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:42,449
(all clapping)

1072
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:50,892
- Fuck. Oh, you fucking liar!

1073
01:24:52,794 --> 01:24:57,065
I can't believe this,
this is not possible!

1074
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:58,900
- You keep saying that?

1075
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:02,135
I can tell you one thing that
is certain, Mr. Matthews.

1076
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:07,642
Here in the quantum realm,
reality is a lot like
your faith.

1077
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:10,645
It is only as real as you
believe it is.

1078
01:25:10,678 --> 01:25:13,881
Unless of course I make it real.

1079
01:25:15,049 --> 01:25:17,417
And that is the key.

1080
01:25:19,754 --> 01:25:24,525
You lack conviction,
you're weak, Mr. Matthews.

1081
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:41,308
(ground rumbling)

1082
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:44,879
(thunder crashes)

1083
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:47,615
(women scream)

1084
01:25:55,623 --> 01:25:58,258
- Barada! What an entrance!

1085
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:00,595
Sic semper tyrannis!

1086
01:26:00,628 --> 01:26:07,101
- Enough of the useless
banter Huuuuummman!

1087
01:26:07,135 --> 01:26:09,604
- Let's get down to
it, shall we, old chap?

1088
01:26:09,637 --> 01:26:12,874
As you know I have fulfilled
my part of our contract.

1089
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:19,914
- I'm afraid I must alter
our agreement.

1090
01:26:19,947 --> 01:26:22,282
- We have a deal, no?

1091
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:24,484
- Not if you are dead.

1092
01:26:26,386 --> 01:26:29,356
(Cerno laughing)

1093
01:26:29,389 --> 01:26:31,324
- What is this?

1094
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:33,094
(thunder crashes)

1095
01:26:33,127 --> 01:26:34,494
WHAT IS THIS!!

1096
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:37,532
- You see,
I am a quick study, Barada.

1097
01:26:38,533 --> 01:26:42,670
- Knowledge does not make
you a god, talking monkey.

1098
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:47,307
- No, being a god
makes me a god!

1099
01:26:50,011 --> 01:26:53,047
Now about our agreement.

1100
01:26:54,015 --> 01:26:57,417
- Enough parlor tricks,
Professor!

1101
01:26:57,451 --> 01:27:00,054
- You should consider
the future Barada.

1102
01:27:00,088 --> 01:27:03,758
Once I rule this realm I will
restructure its hierarchy.

1103
01:27:04,525 --> 01:27:07,628
(Barada laughing)

1104
01:27:09,764 --> 01:27:12,734
- Do you think you are
the first?

1105
01:27:12,767 --> 01:27:16,671
- Of course not,
but I will be the last.

1106
01:27:17,304 --> 01:27:20,440
(Barada laughing)

1107
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:26,214
- Very well, human!

1108
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:29,851
I declare our contract is
fulfilled.

1109
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:32,319
QUANTUM MERUIT.

1110
01:27:32,954 --> 01:27:35,022
- Now, my payment.

1111
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:36,991
Tell me.
- (unintelligible)

1112
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,995
- And nothing less. It must end.

1113
01:27:42,163 --> 01:27:43,396
- Done.

1114
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:47,300
(Cerno sinister laughter)

1115
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:55,977
(drink shaking)

1116
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:56,911
- Yes!

1117
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:25,173
- Heavenly Klaatu,
simply heavenly.

1118
01:28:25,206 --> 01:28:27,975
(glasses clink)

1119
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:32,345
- Are we happy boss?

1120
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:35,783
- Oh yes Klaatu, yes indeed.

1121
01:28:37,384 --> 01:28:40,353
(ominous music)

1122
01:28:56,871 --> 01:28:59,674
(zipper closing)

1123
01:29:08,381 --> 01:29:09,917
- Keep it close, Klaatu.

1124
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:12,352
I have no idea how long
this will last.

1125
01:29:12,954 --> 01:29:15,590
Any word from our headquarters?

1126
01:29:15,623 --> 01:29:16,724
- (Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

1127
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:22,830
- Sir, we have TEXAS on
the sat phone for you.

1128
01:29:22,864 --> 01:29:24,966
- I'll take it in the car,
thank you.

1129
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:29,770
- Sir

1130
01:29:36,911 --> 01:29:37,945
- Hello?

1131
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:38,846
Heinrich?

1132
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:40,915
Heinrich?

1133
01:29:41,949 --> 01:29:43,985
Heinrich, take off
those ridiculous goggles

1134
01:29:44,018 --> 01:29:45,418
and look at me when I
talk to you.

1135
01:29:45,452 --> 01:29:47,154
- Yes, Father, sorry.

1136
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:50,390
I'm fine.

1137
01:29:50,423 --> 01:29:51,826
How is it there?

1138
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:55,162
- Unlike what I am hearing
from Texas,

1139
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:57,999
this experiment was a
rousing success.

1140
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,336
- And what of the inhabitants
of that dimension?

1141
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:04,205
The old dead gods.

1142
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:06,040
- They are of no concern.

1143
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:09,777
As long as we use the Quantum
Tanks, they can not touch us.

1144
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,712
- I'm not quite that far along.

1145
01:30:12,613 --> 01:30:14,215
There are variables.

1146
01:30:14,248 --> 01:30:16,651
They are trying to stop me.

1147
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,920
- Mind your indulgences.

1148
01:30:23,691 --> 01:30:25,660
- Destination sir?

1149
01:30:25,693 --> 01:30:26,994
- The airport, Larry.

1150
01:30:29,397 --> 01:30:32,499
(window whirring)

1151
01:30:44,477 --> 01:30:45,713
- Chop, chop.

1152
01:30:45,746 --> 01:30:46,914
- [Larry] Yes sir.

1153
01:30:48,683 --> 01:30:51,552
(car rumbles)
