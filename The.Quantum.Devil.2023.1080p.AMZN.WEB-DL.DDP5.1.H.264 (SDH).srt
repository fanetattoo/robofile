1
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:18,257
(thunder booming)

2
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,692
(cave crumbling)

3
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,858
(wolf howling)

4
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,891
(ominous music)

5
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,389
(airplane swooshing)

6
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:22,088
(suitcase rattles)

7
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:37,054
- (sighs) Fuck.

8
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:44,921
(car swooshing)

9
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:49,054
(brakes squeak)

10
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:02,621
- Where to?

11
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:06,220
- Traveling, easy to lose stuff.

12
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,320
- You don't know where
you're going?

13
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,320
- Patience usually pays off.

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,053
Here.

15
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,420
(eerie music)

16
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,185
Is there a problem?

17
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,786
- No, no it's,
it's just a long ride.

18
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,686
I was just signing off.

19
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,285
(Luke sighs)

20
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,219
- Yeah, you're seeing the light.

21
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:38,152
Here.

22
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:42,084
- Okay, but when we get there
you get out.

23
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:45,084
You don't fuck around.
You get out.

24
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,486
(taxi rumbling)

25
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:56,785
(thunder booming)

26
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:03,685
(rain tapping)

27
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,418
(uneasy music)

28
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:16,983
(couple moaning and panting)

29
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,683
Hey. Hey, mister.

30
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,416
Your destination. We're here.

31
00:03:58,316 --> 00:03:59,483
Come on!

32
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,316
- Alright, old man.

33
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,249
Fuck.

34
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:04,715
Here.

35
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:05,582
Keep the change.

36
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:06,648
- Out.

37
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:08,782
- I'm sure here in Bumfuck
it goes a long way, huh?

38
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,748
- Get out!

39
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,515
Out! Out! (indistinct)

40
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:12,815
- Alright! Fuck!

41
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,648
Motherfucker!

42
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:15,882
(thunder booming)

43
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,715
(taxi rumbling)

44
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,448
(rain tapping)

45
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:24,881
(thunder booming)

46
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:33,080
(footsteps splash)

47
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,145
(gate clanking)

48
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,545
(eerie music)

49
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,412
(lighter clicks)

50
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:34,345
Hello?

51
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:50,311
What the fuck?

52
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,478
(lighter clicks)

53
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:11,777
Fuck!

54
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,944
(sinister music)

55
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,310
- A lovely pring you did.

56
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:20,008
- I don't understand.

57
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,809
- So, I guess you're the one.

58
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,243
- The one what?

59
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,642
(Klaatu laughs)

60
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:34,509
(sinister music)

61
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:49,375
- Oh, you've got to be
shitting me.

62
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,775
(uneasy music)

63
00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:00,374
(ominous music)

64
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:21,140
(doors creaking)

65
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,773
(Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

66
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,673
- I don't understand you.

67
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:49,439
(uneasy music)

68
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:14,705
(Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

69
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:18,371
- He says you're like a lamb
to slaughter.

70
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,938
- Oh my God, let him
in. He is soaking wet!

71
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,671
Please get him a towel.

72
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:31,204
(Klaatu laughs)

73
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,103
I know, creepy right?

74
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,270
- Yeah.

75
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,870
- You are?

76
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,070
- Luke Matthews.

77
00:08:47,137 --> 00:08:48,503
- Your towel.

78
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:51,003
Dinner will be served
promptly at eight.

79
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:52,903
Do not be late.

80
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,903
- Hey, wait.

81
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,470
Goddammit.

82
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,969
Excuse me.

83
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,503
Fuck,

84
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,269
- So you too?

85
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:03,670
- What?

86
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:05,136
Sorry, yeah.

87
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,769
I received an unmarked envelope

88
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,969
and a one way plane ticket and-

89
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,269
- an impossible
quantum/bio-quantum equation

90
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,937
that could change life as
we know it?

91
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,268
- Well yes.

92
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:24,001
And you are?

93
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,101
- Ivanna Escalante.

94
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,634
Don't judge a book by
its cover, smart guy.

95
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:34,634
Beneath this exterior beats
the heart of a rationalist.

96
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,868
My graduate dissertation
is on quantum mechanics.

97
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,367
- And who was that?

98
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:43,601
The staff?

99
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:44,534
- I guess.

100
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,034
I don't really know.

101
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,034
The rest of us got in
earlier this afternoon.

102
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,601
- Hello.

103
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:56,767
(sighs) My name is
Sophia Sokolova,

104
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,433
but please call me Sophie.

105
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,700
- Luke Matthews.

106
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,834
Russian?

107
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,067
- Yes, you are correct.

108
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,200
- It's nice to meet you.

109
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,633
So are you an aspiring
physicist as well?

110
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:14,633
- No, I'm not really aspiring
to anything.

111
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:20,166
I am-- well was a medical
student.

112
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,966
Of sorts. Hard to explain.

113
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,033
- And?

114
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:28,199
Go on, tell him.

115
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:31,265
This is fucking cool.

116
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,766
- I suppose what you would
call me is an empath.

117
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:43,833
- An empath, you mean like
a psychic or medium?

118
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,365
- You might say that.

119
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,299
- Gloves?

120
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:51,498
- That's protection.

121
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:56,465
- So, uh, what so you
say we show you around,

122
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:59,698
introduce you to Brad and you
can freshen up before dinner?

123
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:01,198
- That sounds good.

124
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,498
I just need to find a bathroom.

125
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,630
- Of course.

126
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,597
Around the corner, on the left.

127
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,832
- Got it.

128
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:18,832
- Another scientist?
He seems nice.

129
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:21,096
- I hope so.

130
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:23,464
- What do you mean?

131
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:29,497
- I don't know;
something seems weird.

132
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,763
Sorry, Ivanna -- never mind.

133
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:35,797
- One of your premonitions?

134
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:41,262
- I sense --desperation.

135
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:45,396
Someone running away from
something.

136
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:51,062
Someone with something to hide.

137
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,763
- And you're getting that
from the ether?

138
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:09,929
(thunder cracks)

139
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,260
- [Luke] This is something
else huh?

140
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,160
- We haven't had much time
to explore,

141
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:30,427
but yes,
I'd say "something else"

142
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,993
- Is "it" here?

143
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,060
Have you seen it?

144
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,127
- It's safe.

145
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
- [Brad] You sure?

146
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:37,494
- Yes, come and meet Luke.

147
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,794
- I never should have come.

148
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,027
- Brad, this is Luke.

149
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,794
- Luke Matthews.
It's nice to meet you

150
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,493
- That motherfucker is
not right.

151
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:53,927
I am telling you that
he isn't right and

152
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,493
- Yeah, well,
an associate professor

153
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:06,559
of physics and quantum mechanics
at Miskatonic University.

154
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:12,092
- Ah yes. Myself,
the pharmaceutical sciences.

155
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,959
So what did you make of
that invitation?

156
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:17,693
- I'm not sure really.

157
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:21,091
It's fascinating, it's
curiosity-inspiring.

158
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,759
But of course it's improbable.

159
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,459
- I must say I disagree.

160
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:28,659
- Really?
'cause you always disa-

161
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,926
(glass shatters)

162
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,091
- What was that?

163
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:36,091
(ominous music)

164
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,291
- [Ivanna] Are you okay?

165
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,591
What is it?

166
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,623
- I don't know, I felt a
surge of psionic energy

167
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,925
just as I heard the crash.

168
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,157
I still feel it.

169
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,090
- Do you expect me to
believe in the impossible?

170
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:57,557
- Believe what you want,

171
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,423
but didn't you just fly
halfway around the world

172
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:02,457
to investigate something you
claim to be "impossible"?

173
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,825
- What is this?

174
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:08,989
- This? It was not us.

175
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,956
- (Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

176
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:12,924
- We can clean it if you want.

177
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:19,757
- NO! Dinner will be served
shortly and your honored host

178
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,422
- (together) Understand?

179
00:14:22,456 --> 00:14:26,988
- Great effort, many were
expended to greet you

180
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:30,355
all here for this momentous
occasion.

181
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,355
Now, if you please.

182
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,189
Chop, chop!

183
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:56,888
(glass clinking)

184
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,487
- Chop, chop.

185
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,253
(Klaatu laughs)

186
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,654
- This is me.

187
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,053
I just need a moment.

188
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,654
- And I am across the hall here.

189
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,519
I will meet you guys downstairs.

190
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:34,654
- I do prefer a little privacy

191
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,519
so I took a room
on the other end.

192
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,886
There's plenty to choose from.

193
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:42,920
Do you smoke?

194
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,820
- Cigarettes? No thanks.

195
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,786
- Not cigarettes. Cannabis?

196
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
- I don't mean just to get high.

197
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,286
I mean I use it as a tool

198
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,985
to help unfocus my
social anxiety.

199
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:59,619
- You know it's funny,
sometimes the herb mellows

200
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,653
and then other times -

201
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:02,185
- she kicks your ass.

202
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:05,653
- Yeah,
I could use some of that.

203
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:17,118
(Luke coughs)

204
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,317
- This is a special
cush, really nice dreams.

205
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,050
- Muchos Gracias Senor.

206
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,684
- Ass kicked already.

207
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,383
- Cool.

208
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,783
Wow, strong shit.

209
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,716
(thunder cracks)

210
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,348
(door creaks)

211
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:11,516
(thunder cracks)

212
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,816
- Weird.

213
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:22,749
The fuck was I doing?

214
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:24,248
Hmm.

215
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,346
Fuck me.

216
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:08,280
(melancholy music)

217
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:41,712
(knocking on door)

218
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,646
- [Ivanna] Hey, Sophie.
You ready?

219
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,746
- (under her breath) Of
course, you dumb bitch.

220
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,845
(ominous music)

221
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:10,811
(gong resinates)

222
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:13,445
- Please be seated.

223
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,510
- Oh

224
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:30,911
- I say we eac-

225
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,975
- SILENCE!

226
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:36,810
Ladies, gentlemen,
distinguished guests.

227
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:41,009
I present Dr. Richard Cernovich.

228
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,810
(bangs gong)

229
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,509
- Call me Cerno.

230
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:50,810
Klaatu, attend me.

231
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,409
(Klaatu laughs)

232
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,008
- Ice cold.

233
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,074
(liquid pouring)

234
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,974
- Heaven Klaatu.

235
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:20,908
Well, I hope you have all
found the accommodations

236
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,608
to your liking?

237
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,940
- Cernovich? ...Cernovich?

238
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:28,973
- I know that name.

239
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:32,241
- [Cerno] The devil you do.

240
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,908
- A colleague of mine, turned
me on to some research papers

241
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,139
written by a
Professor Richard Cernovich.

242
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,541
The man was a genius.

243
00:20:45,574 --> 00:20:50,307
A pioneer in neuropsychiatry,
theoretical physics

244
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,939
and an innovator in
the field of quantum biology.

245
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:56,240
- That same Cernovich was
banished from academia

246
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,873
and exiled from
the United States

247
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:02,138
for unethical human
experimentation in 1973.

248
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:04,206
All records from his
mind-mapping sub-project

249
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:08,772
were destroyed and it's very
existence classified Top Secret.

250
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:11,105
- The Cernovich Horrors?

251
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:15,005
- So you're the Manchurian
Candidate guy.

252
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,306
- Long time ago.

253
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:19,405
- A lot of dead people
because of you.

254
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:22,605
- Murder, mutilation,
genocides, slavery,

255
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,472
all have been perpetuated
under frameworks that said they

256
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,572
were lawful and legal,

257
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:30,806
as long as you abided
by the regulations.

258
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:35,037
- Trauma based mind control,
MK Ultra, Project Parrot,

259
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,137
Project Doll.

260
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:42,172
Experimenting on human
populations, LSD,

261
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,304
behavioral control of
entire cultures.

262
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:50,704
- That wasn't my program
but I did take it over, yes.

263
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:55,804
My son heads it up now,
or what's left of it.

264
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:57,936
All above board and legal.

265
00:21:57,969 --> 00:22:01,637
As you said yourself,
Mr. Matthews,

266
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,036
I was an innovator, a scientist.

267
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:07,204
A respected member of
the academic community

268
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:10,936
until a moment of political
cowardice.

269
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:16,035
Literally overnight I became
a disgrace, a criminal,

270
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,170
but not without a code
of conduct.

271
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:25,736
Klaatu,

272
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,769
siticulosus.

273
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:48,001
Thank you Klaatu.

274
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:51,967
Well enough about me.

275
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:54,768
Let's go around
the horn shall we,

276
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:57,134
and really get acquainted.

277
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:02,501
Brad Richards, born in Zaria,
Nigeria.

278
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:06,168
A pharmaceutical scientist,
mathematician and chemist

279
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,301
hailing from
Kings College London.

280
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,033
His main research
interests are in

281
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:15,234
the areas of breathable gases,
anesthesia.

282
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,267
As well as the development of
designer recreational drugs

283
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,734
with particular emphasis
on ecstasy.

284
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,467
- No.

285
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,833
- [Cerno] The local tabloids
dubbed him

286
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:31,200
"The Pied Piper of Manchester."

287
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,599
His designer pills would
lure thousands of teenagers

288
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,066
to massive rave parties,

289
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,900
until one fateful night
last September.

290
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,999
When some 250 teenagers died.

291
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:50,299
Thanks to a young hot shot
city barrister

292
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:53,032
Brad was acquitted on a
technicality.

293
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,466
Narrowly escaping an angry
mob of grieving parents,

294
00:23:56,499 --> 00:23:59,832
Brad slipped out of the
country in the dead of night,

295
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:04,199
not to be seen again, until now.

296
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,632
- Not true.

297
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,198
- Oh, but it is.

298
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,465
Feeling a little anxious are we?

299
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:16,930
- It, first of all,
it wasn't my fault.

300
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:18,864
- Relax, Mr. Richards.

301
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:20,930
No need to explain.

302
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:23,464
You're among friends here.

303
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:25,165
We understand your
social phobias.

304
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,098
- So do you have a file on
each of us?

305
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,963
- The man always has a file.

306
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,197
- A first-generation US
citizen of Argentinian descent,

307
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,230
and the first in her
family to attend college.

308
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:42,531
Ivanna earned her Bachelor's
of Science in Physics

309
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:48,830
from the University of
California San Diego in 2015,

310
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,097
graduating at the top of
her class.

311
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,463
She was awarded

312
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:56,963
the Physical Sciences Dean's
Undergraduate Award for

313
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:00,896
In addition the Dean also
awarded her

314
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,829
with a scandalous affair.

315
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,829
- We would have broken all
the barriers.

316
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:09,096
You and me.

317
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:14,629
- Yes, you're very fond
of loyalty, aren't you.

318
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:19,029
You have nothing to
fear from me.

319
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:22,895
I am loyal to those who
deserve it.

320
00:25:26,728 --> 00:25:29,228
Sophie Sokolov.

321
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,128
You have been obsessed with
NDE phenomena

322
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:34,594
ever since the tragic
loss of your twin sister

323
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:37,095
at the tender age of eleven.

324
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:40,661
However it was this
tragedy that awakened your

325
00:25:40,694 --> 00:25:42,361
special "gift".

326
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:45,461
Sophie was recently
dismissed from her residency

327
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:49,060
at Novosibirsk State Medical
University.

328
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,127
Seems she fell in with a
small group

329
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:56,794
of students conducting
clandestine experiments

330
00:25:56,827 --> 00:26:00,326
to produce near-death
experiences.

331
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:05,527
Unable to prove which one
of the suspects administered

332
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,560
the drug that stopped
the victim's heart,

333
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:13,093
the case was thrown out
and the charges dismissed.

334
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:16,059
- Kapstein knew the risk.

335
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:19,826
- If I'm not mistaken
poor Mr. Kapstein ran

336
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,426
into problems in Syracuse.

337
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:27,059
Apparently, he was worse
than you with volunteers.

338
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:29,392
(slight laugh)

339
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:34,459
You killed Hank Jones, who
gave the injection to Kapstein.

340
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,459
You are nothing if not
prodigious.

341
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:41,591
Jabbed that sucker right
into his neck.

342
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:47,025
Fired dose after dose into
him, popped the carotid artery.

343
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,458
And they say the blood is still

344
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:53,458
in the cracks of the floor
and under the cabinets.

345
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,725
Impressive.

346
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,491
- You're enjoying this.

347
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:03,657
- I have to hand it to you,
Sophie, you got away with it.

348
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,124
Simply disappeared to
the UK as a new resident,

349
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:14,257
outside the purview of our
mutual friend, Inspector Tanaka.

350
00:27:14,957 --> 00:27:17,457
- You're a blackmailer in
the spirit.

351
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,624
- Nothing so harsh,
Sophie. An offer.

352
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,956
(bangs table)

353
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,023
- You don't need to say it.

354
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:29,956
I did it!

355
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,456
I killed my fiancé.

356
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,456
I didn't mean to.

357
00:27:43,089 --> 00:27:45,356
- [Cerno] Oh but you did.

358
00:27:57,555 --> 00:27:58,455
- Yes.

359
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:04,823
- No worries Luke,
Honorem latrones.

360
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:08,321
- Latin.
"There is honor among thieves."

361
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,221
- I think what he
means to say is

362
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,855
that he thinks he can trust us.

363
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:15,687
- With what?

364
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:18,188
Why the security?

365
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,121
Paranoia?

366
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:26,120
- Each one of you have been
searching for the same thing,

367
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:29,087
albeit for different reasons.

368
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,854
A way to breach
the Quantum Barrier.

369
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:39,053
- The key to the manipulation
of time is control of space.

370
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:42,453
Perhaps, the answer to
the mystery of the afterlife

371
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,686
is in death.

372
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,420
What happens when we die?

373
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:52,854
Is it like Buddha said,
a candle blowing out.

374
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:56,186
One cannot say where
the flame went.

375
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,952
- What do you think is
out there?

376
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,052
- Creation itself.

377
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,186
Obviously, it doesn't come from

378
00:29:09,218 --> 00:29:11,218
what has already been created,

379
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,919
from the world we live in.

380
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,853
So it must be there.

381
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:21,385
Coming from what is darkness
to us now.

382
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:26,951
Sophie, you see beings
from there as they enter

383
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:29,886
into our space, yes.

384
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,819
- Yes.

385
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:36,484
- Now just imagine going there,

386
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:38,317
in the same way.

387
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:41,584
Except with all aspects
of control and purpose.

388
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:48,050
Not for a flash of an instant
with DMT or LSD or meditation,

389
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:53,583
but as a sentient being.

390
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,950
Capable of everything.

391
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,684
Let's get down to business
shall we?

392
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:08,949
Klaatu.

393
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:13,016
(Klaatu bangs gong)

394
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,016
- Mein ibento o hikidasu.

395
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:25,015
- My friends, I give you
the greatest quantum

396
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:28,115
of the last 200 years,

397
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,816
Quantamine.

398
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:35,982
- There is a risk.

399
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:37,481
- This is not from a
human source.

400
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,948
- So if I may ask,
Professor, where is it from?

401
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,481
- Fuck.

402
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,616
- It's very existence
defies the laws of nature.

403
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:47,348
- It comes from them. And
you don't fuck with them.

404
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,081
- As it should be with
a substance

405
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,981
that can rearrange every
molecule in and around your body

406
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:54,248
instantaneously upon contact.

407
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:57,515
- I believe that within
each one of you

408
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:01,715
lies a piece of the key to
breaching the quantum barrier.

409
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:04,581
We have known this was
possible on a quantum level

410
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,514
for some time now.

411
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:09,681
Theorem with protons,
magnetic fields, lasers,

412
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:11,914
sonic resonance.

413
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:17,347
What was missing was
the biomechanical component,

414
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:19,581
the quantamine and--

415
00:31:19,615 --> 00:31:20,714
- The soul.

416
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:23,147
- The psychic component.
Control.

417
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,747
- The nexus, perhaps.

418
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,013
- Dangerous.

419
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:28,680
- Illegal.

420
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,747
- Now, I have a crude but
sufficient lab

421
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:36,614
set up here in the house.

422
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,714
Would any of you care
to join me?

423
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:44,613
(lightswitch flicks)

424
00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:46,346
- This way please.

425
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:48,445
Mind your step!

426
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:53,278
The Quantum Chamber!

427
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,846
- What the--

428
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,780
- Yeah man! We all owe you a
thanks, in advance, friends.

429
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:02,978
- Slow down. The dead, huh?

430
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:04,713
- You worried, young man?

431
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,579
- Don't be troubled, Luke.

432
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:08,478
Your soul is beautiful.

433
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:09,478
- What about mine?

434
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,345
- I don't think--

435
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,044
- Quiet now!

436
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:24,645
- I see,
you are using tuning forks

437
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,411
to generate a frequency

438
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,344
- Very good.

439
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,177
- To synchronize the proton
waves within this chamber.

440
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,344
- How did you determine
the correct frequency?

441
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:36,611
- I haven't, yet. But
now that you are here.

442
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:41,677
- Did you actually achieve
a stable atomization

443
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,209
- We did indeed.

444
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,410
However the liquid form
of the quantamine seems

445
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:48,909
to dissolve the skin tissue
upon contact.

446
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,176
- Sophie, what is it?

447
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,576
- I sense darkness, a presence.

448
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,810
- Perhaps you are sensing
the recent loss of life

449
00:33:00,843 --> 00:33:02,443
in this very room.

450
00:33:02,476 --> 00:33:03,610
- Loss of life?

451
00:33:03,643 --> 00:33:06,076
- Yes, Dr. Wallace
Keith, a dear old friend

452
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:08,877
and long time colleague
was rather careless during

453
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:12,576
our last attempt to breach
the barrier -- and it cost us.

454
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,776
- It cost him.

455
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:18,476
- For me, the use of my legs.

456
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:21,575
For Wallace, his life.

457
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,842
- A word

458
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:27,274
(Klaatu whispering)

459
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,442
- I am afraid I have an
urgent matter

460
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:33,809
requiring my immediate
attention.

461
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:36,374
I must leave for Geneva at once.

462
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,974
I shall not be more than a
day or two.

463
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,174
- What about us?

464
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:44,775
What do you want us to do then?

465
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:49,608
- Please, by all means proceed,
my dear.

466
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:51,508
Everything that happens
in this lab

467
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,306
is automatically documented
and recorded

468
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,106
on a secure server here
in the house.

469
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,039
I expect you lot can pick
up where we left off.

470
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,240
- What's in it for us Cerno?

471
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:08,640
- What is it that you want Mr.
Matthews?

472
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,106
Credit, Fame?

473
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:13,906
How about a a Nobel prize?

474
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,973
I know without a doubt,

475
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:17,673
each one of you would
complete this experiment.

476
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:23,139
If for no other reason then
to satisfy your own curiosity.

477
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:30,038
$500,000 each.

478
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,005
Enough to start over.

479
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,873
A fresh start, a new name.

480
00:34:35,905 --> 00:34:39,271
Freedom from the past.

481
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:40,905
What say you?

482
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:41,873
- Done.

483
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:43,971
- Yes, I agree.

484
00:34:44,872 --> 00:34:47,506
- Yes, yes of course.

485
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:49,271
- Excellent.

486
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,805
Fortune favors the bold
my friends.

487
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,037
Alea jacta est.

488
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:08,671
(thunder crashes)

489
00:35:11,505 --> 00:35:14,571
(rain falls)

490
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,837
(ominous music)

491
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:31,837
(button buzzes)

492
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,201
- All right, how do we ingest
a drug that we can't touch

493
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:50,935
because it literally eats flesh?

494
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,669
- I don't believe it is
eating the flesh.

495
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:56,336
I believe the quantamine is
instantaneously breaching

496
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:59,503
the barrier between this
dimension and the next.

497
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:01,802
- You mean that the parts of
the body in direct contact

498
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:05,235
with the liquid are still
there, here?

499
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:08,869
You know what I mean,
but in another dimension?

500
00:36:09,802 --> 00:36:11,068
- Basic, but yeah.

501
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,735
- Yes, basic, like you.

502
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:14,769
- You wish.

503
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:18,235
- Hey, can we not. Please?

504
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:24,200
- Okay. No one could survive
that state of dual separation.

505
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:32,534
What we have to do is balance
the quantum entanglement.

506
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:35,267
- Please, go on.

507
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:40,133
- Perhaps simultaneously
immersing the body in some type

508
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,667
of quantamine based
saline solution

509
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,199
at the same time of injection?

510
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:45,833
- No, we do not have
enough quantamine for that,

511
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:46,932
nor any type of float
tank big enough

512
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:48,666
to accommodate even one of us.

513
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,300
But, according to these notes,

514
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,400
Cerno and his colleague
they were almost there.

515
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:59,700
Here. Look at this.

516
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,899
- Ah! I see.

517
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:05,633
So, what if when I change
the state of the quantamine

518
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:08,666
from it's liquid form,
to the atmospheric gas.

519
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,533
We also generate a more
refined breathable gas?

520
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,931
Which I can dilute with a
solution to allow the body

521
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:17,599
enough time to achieve
superposition.

522
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,165
- Yes!

523
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,399
A critical balance between
the internal

524
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:24,931
and external exposure to
the quantamine,

525
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:26,665
all at a controlled rate.

526
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,097
- OK, all right. With your help
I can rig these tuning forks

527
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,131
to generate a frequency,

528
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:36,131
a constant 432 Hz which
should synchronize the proton

529
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:37,664
within the chamber with
the atomization of

530
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:40,265
the quantamine gas.

531
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:41,564
- I'm your girl.

532
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,631
- And, according to
Cerno's notes,

533
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:49,398
this 'thing' will amplify my
psionic abilities and link us,

534
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:51,096
our consciousness.

535
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:55,096
This will allow me to
act as a 'mental anchor.'

536
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:03,430
- Guys, I think this is
going to work.

537
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,864
(ominous music)

538
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:12,797
(metal door creaks)

539
00:38:29,995 --> 00:38:32,195
- Klaatu! Klaatu!

540
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:40,795
I expect everything is
proceeding according to my plan?

541
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:42,862
- Flawlessly, Sir.

542
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:47,396
- Good. Let us begin, shall we?

543
00:38:56,495 --> 00:38:59,595
(air hissing)

544
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:03,528
(door creaking)

545
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:07,294
(ominous music)

546
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,327
(door creaks and closes)

547
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,760
- Are you ready sir?

548
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,793
- Age quod agis!

549
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,759
(air hissing)

550
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,326
(dramatic music)

551
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:02,625
(keys typing)

552
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,225
(machine whirring)

553
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:04,390
- Come, come, come.

554
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:07,589
Slow, slow.

555
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:33,055
(knobs click)

556
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:48,820
(beds creaking)

557
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,320
- All right. Anyone want out?

558
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:18,186
Last chance.

559
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:21,186
No?

560
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,519
All right sound off as I
count us down.

561
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:28,552
- 1st position, go.

562
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:32,619
(air hissing)

563
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:34,853
- 2nd position, go.

564
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,219
(tuning forks ringing)

565
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:44,385
- Mind linking: 3, 2 -- 1.

566
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:52,885
- Command position in 3, 2, 1.

567
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:57,917
(electricity buzzing)

568
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:05,917
- (Sophie screams)

569
00:43:09,884 --> 00:43:12,884
(ominous music)

570
00:43:28,683 --> 00:43:31,784
(thunder crashes)

571
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:36,449
(water sloshes)

572
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:43,182
(dramatic music)

573
00:44:55,714 --> 00:44:58,380
(Luke panting)

574
00:45:52,343 --> 00:45:54,276
- What happened?

575
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,711
- I'm a little hazy me-self.

576
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,310
- I just woke up on
the bathroom floor?

577
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,009
I don't remember--

578
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:06,744
- What the hell happened?

579
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:08,076
- Shouldn't you know?

580
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:11,710
- What did you assholes
do to me?

581
00:46:11,744 --> 00:46:13,210
- I could say the same.

582
00:46:13,243 --> 00:46:15,976
- Hey, hey, we're all a
little concerned about

583
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:18,810
how exactly things what
went down last night.

584
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:20,509
We all need to calm down.

585
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,342
- What? Did you all lure me
into a trap or what something?

586
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:24,275
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can
sod off with that rubbish!

587
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:26,142
- Who lured you into a trap?

588
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:27,908
What the fuck are you
talking about?

589
00:46:27,942 --> 00:46:29,008
- I could ask you the same.

590
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:31,409
- Why can't I shine?

591
00:46:31,975 --> 00:46:33,809
It's a blank since the lab.

592
00:46:33,843 --> 00:46:36,075
- [Ivanna] When has that
ever happened?

593
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:38,475
- Something is heavy.

594
00:46:38,508 --> 00:46:43,642
A block,
some sort of physic barrier.

595
00:46:44,308 --> 00:46:45,809
- The Lab!

596
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:48,441
The cameras!

597
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,541
- FUCK!!!

598
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,541
The Quantamine is gone.

599
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:54,541
- [Brad] The fuck?

600
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:55,907
- [Sophie] What is it?
- Check the computer.

601
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:57,074
Do we have video?

602
00:46:57,842 --> 00:46:58,808
Anything?

603
00:46:58,842 --> 00:46:59,308
(keys typing)

604
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:00,808
Move.

605
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:05,240
What'd you do?

606
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,575
- Did you try the back up?

607
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:08,907
- That is the back-up.

608
00:47:15,107 --> 00:47:17,207
The gas system is fucked.

609
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,973
- What about the scanners?

610
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:21,273
The paper readouts?

611
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:22,207
- Uh,

612
00:47:24,473 --> 00:47:26,574
it's, it's gone,

613
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:29,239
everything from the breach
point is gone.

614
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:30,674
Sophie, you're our meta link.

615
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:32,707
- I have nothing but a
splitting headache?

616
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:34,339
- Of course 'cause
fucking useless.

617
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:36,005
- (in Russian) Yob tvoyu mat!

618
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:37,741
- Hey! Hey, hey-- come on guys.

619
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,039
That is not going to help us.

620
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,106
- I'm sorry, I just--

621
00:47:41,673 --> 00:47:44,406
- I don't know about the rest
of you but I am so thirsty.

622
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:46,005
We need a break.

623
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,239
Let's get some coffee,
catch our breath,

624
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:50,639
then we will sort this all out?

625
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:54,506
- Yeah, I need some smoke.

626
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:04,938
- Sorry.

627
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,305
(sad music)

628
00:48:18,137 --> 00:48:20,237
- You can't really live
with what happened,

629
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,538
because you feel so deeply,

630
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:26,204
so much guilt.

631
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:28,970
It's delicious.
Watching you struggle.

632
00:48:29,003 --> 00:48:31,237
- What the fuck.

633
00:48:31,337 --> 00:48:33,671
- How can you live
with yourself?

634
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:36,170
With what you did?

635
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,838
- What the fuck is this?

636
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,671
- What the fuck is this?

637
00:48:39,704 --> 00:48:42,303
(keys typing)

638
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:48,203
- [Sophie And Katia] GUYS!
Guys come back here and--

639
00:48:49,902 --> 00:48:51,803
(dramatic music)

640
00:48:51,837 --> 00:48:55,136
(television static)

641
00:49:14,802 --> 00:49:17,302
- [Sophie And Katia] Ouch!

642
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:20,235
What the fucking fuck stop!

643
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:25,769
Now listen here you fucking stop

644
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:29,134
and I mean right fucking now you

645
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:32,934
Zacroy svoy peesavati
rot, sooka.

646
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:38,967
(Sophie screams)

647
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:52,067
- It's okay, can you hear me?

648
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,900
- Here let me help.

649
00:49:56,434 --> 00:49:57,568
All right I got a pulse.

650
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:59,601
Let's get her downstairs.

651
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:00,634
(all grunting)

652
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:02,434
- Got her? Got her?

653
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:06,166
Here take her, take her, watch
her head, watch her head.

654
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:08,700
- No

655
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:09,500
- Let me help you.

656
00:50:09,533 --> 00:50:10,467
- Don't.

657
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,400
- I'm trying to help you.

658
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:12,033
- Don't, don't touch me.

659
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:12,966
- Okay, fuck.

660
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:13,700
- [Brad] Take a hit.

661
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:14,667
- NOOO!

662
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,866
(Sophie screams)

663
00:50:18,467 --> 00:50:19,834
I'm so sorry.

664
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,898
I just have to work
through this.

665
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:24,032
I have not felt this
out of control since--

666
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,165
since my sister--

667
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,467
- Let me help you to your room,

668
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,733
maybe if you just lay
down a bit,

669
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:31,032
have some quiet time
to yourself.

670
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:35,833
- Yeah, but please do
not touch me.

671
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,198
I can sense you all now.

672
00:50:37,231 --> 00:50:39,131
Even without a physical
connection.

673
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:42,466
When you touch me,
it's too much.

674
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:43,332
- Will these work?

675
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:45,499
- Yes, thank you.

676
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:51,332
And guys, I will be as
succinct as possible.

677
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:53,131
You ALL--

678
00:50:53,164 --> 00:50:55,832
You need to go rub one out,
masturbate.

679
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:56,964
Play with yourself.

680
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:58,331
Do whatever it is you need to do

681
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:00,798
to ease some of this
sexual tension.

682
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:03,331
- Ah yes,
a side effect of the quantamine.

683
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:07,732
- Some of you have some
really kinky fetishes.

684
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:10,797
Definitely more than I
want to know about you.

685
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:12,163
Ever.

686
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:15,230
- Come on hon,
let's get you upstairs.

687
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:16,431
- Yeah, thanks.

688
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:18,397
- Rub one out? Right.

689
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,497
- Maybe I'll take you up on
your offer.

690
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,430
- What?

691
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:23,262
- The smoke?

692
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:24,963
- Oh yeah.

693
00:51:24,996 --> 00:51:27,564
You are more than welcome Luke.

694
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,763
- I can feel--

695
00:51:49,663 --> 00:51:50,796
- No

696
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,463
- I can't help it.

697
00:51:56,663 --> 00:51:58,629
- I don't think we are safe.

698
00:51:58,663 --> 00:52:01,228
- From Brad?

699
00:52:01,262 --> 00:52:02,095
Luke?

700
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:05,428
- No, something else.

701
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:16,795
I'm going to take a shower.

702
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:37,159
(door closes)

703
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:54,093
(water splashes)

704
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:05,991
(rings clang on show rod)

705
00:53:06,025 --> 00:53:08,792
(sad music)

706
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,392
(ominous sound)

707
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:43,424
(suitcase clicks)

708
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:47,524
- You are serious.

709
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,391
- Always.

710
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:55,324
When I was 11 years old I
scored 162 on the Mensa test.

711
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,056
Earning the label of
child genius

712
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,824
and considered to be
the smartest boy in London.

713
00:54:00,856 --> 00:54:04,023
The social anxiety alone
was crippling.

714
00:54:05,023 --> 00:54:06,989
- Gets you picked on a lot.

715
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:08,824
- Exactly.

716
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,657
This!

717
00:54:13,557 --> 00:54:16,490
Sativa-dominant hybrid,

718
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,490
(Brad sniffs)

719
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,390
White Fire!

720
00:54:27,656 --> 00:54:29,022
- Wow.

721
00:54:29,055 --> 00:54:30,622
- Initially you will
find it a very uplifting

722
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:32,723
and euphoric feeling.

723
00:54:33,055 --> 00:54:34,622
Then it induces a calming,

724
00:54:34,656 --> 00:54:38,456
somewhat sedentary effect
as you start to come down.

725
00:54:39,189 --> 00:54:41,589
This is probably due to its
significant concentrations

726
00:54:41,622 --> 00:54:46,854
of Beta-Caryophyllene,
Limonene, and Alpha Humulene.

727
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:51,488
It averages at about 22-25% THC;

728
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:55,755
and it's also known to
have CBD as high as 5%.

729
00:54:55,788 --> 00:55:00,822
In either case, it should
put you right to sleep,

730
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:04,555
right after you "rub one out".

731
00:55:04,588 --> 00:55:07,588
- On second thought, I
am going to take a pass.

732
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:09,886
- Suit yourself, mate.

733
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:12,620
- I appreciate the offer though.

734
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:17,986
- Anytime, Luke.

735
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:32,820
- [Kathy] Hey lover.

736
00:55:34,753 --> 00:55:36,153
- Hello?

737
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:39,353
(ominous laughter)

738
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:44,619
(creepy music)

739
00:55:46,852 --> 00:55:48,286
Hello?

740
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,552
(door shuts)

741
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,718
(Kathy laughs ominously)

742
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:21,517
(keys clicking)

743
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:23,651
- Ouch! Shit!

744
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:27,584
- (Klaatu laughing) Bitch.

745
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,484
(water splashing)

746
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:38,250
- Biscuit.

747
00:56:40,584 --> 00:56:41,484
Bangers.

748
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:45,084
Mash.

749
00:56:54,683 --> 00:56:55,783
Munchies.

750
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,148
(ominous music)

751
00:57:46,281 --> 00:57:48,514
(growling)

752
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:57,447
(Klaatu sniffing)

753
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,079
(growling)

754
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,812
(creepy music)

755
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:30,376
(water splashing)

756
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:35,509
(pounding on door)

757
00:59:38,777 --> 00:59:39,876
- Ivanna?

758
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:47,209
Hey, um, I didn't mean
to come off as bitch.

759
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:48,509
You know?

760
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,975
- [Ivanna] I'm sorry too.

761
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:53,242
I didn't believe you at first.

762
00:59:53,276 --> 00:59:54,742
- Ivanna?

763
00:59:54,776 --> 00:59:57,842
(water splashing)

764
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:13,241
(Sophie screams)

765
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:16,075
- What the hell are you doing?

766
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:31,174
(ominous music)

767
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:33,307
Hello?

768
01:01:07,472 --> 01:01:08,372
Ah okay.

769
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:10,872
Haha.

770
01:01:12,105 --> 01:01:13,872
What do you want?

771
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,905
You still mad at me?

772
01:01:16,938 --> 01:01:19,238
(scoffs)

773
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:31,005
(door rattles)

774
01:01:43,738 --> 01:01:46,771
(mirror squeaks)

775
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:57,103
- Hello Sister,

776
01:01:59,705 --> 01:02:02,869
it has been too long!

777
01:02:06,003 --> 01:02:07,503
(mirror shatters)

778
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:10,437
(Sophie Chocking)

779
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:26,804
(blood squirting)

780
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:29,536
(Katia laughs)

781
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:33,336
My dear Sophie,

782
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:38,868
now you can finally have
the answers you have

783
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:42,568
all of your pathetic life!

784
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:47,803
So you want to know happened
after what you did to me?

785
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:50,934
When you murdered me?

786
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,967
Here, sister, see for yourself,
tell me.

787
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:58,401
What do you see?

788
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:07,300
Welcome to the eternal night!

789
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:23,167
Goodbye sister.

790
01:03:59,498 --> 01:04:00,864
- No please!

791
01:04:00,898 --> 01:04:03,231
Let me go!

792
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:06,265
Let me-- come back!

793
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,464
(ominous music)

794
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:25,796
(electronic music)

795
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:39,058
- Oh God No!

796
01:06:39,091 --> 01:06:40,258
Spit the out.

797
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,091
It's poison.

798
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:46,291
No! Spit them out!

799
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:47,392
I made them.

800
01:06:47,426 --> 01:06:48,326
No!

801
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,725
Please listen to me.

802
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:51,924
Spit them out.

803
01:06:51,957 --> 01:06:55,158
(electronic music)

804
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:05,890
(people growling)

805
01:07:13,425 --> 01:07:14,791
(flesh ripping)

806
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:17,856
(Brad screaming)

807
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:41,523
- Please forgive me!

808
01:07:44,056 --> 01:07:47,423
(clothes ripping)

809
01:07:47,456 --> 01:07:50,690
(Brad screaming)

810
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:53,690
- God, please forgive me!

811
01:07:53,723 --> 01:07:55,188
Ahhhhhh.

812
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:03,088
(Luke and Kathy moaning)

813
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:34,454
(Kathy laughing)

814
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:06,152
(fleshing squelching)

815
01:09:10,353 --> 01:09:12,253
- Oh, fuck!

816
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:13,885
Oh God!

817
01:09:14,552 --> 01:09:15,951
Oh Fuck!

818
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,085
Jesus!

819
01:09:21,419 --> 01:09:22,319
Shit!

820
01:09:26,818 --> 01:09:28,519
- You cocksucker!

821
01:09:28,552 --> 01:09:31,051
I was just about to cum
for a change.

822
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:35,319
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

823
01:09:35,352 --> 01:09:36,051
You're dead.

824
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:37,484
I know you're dead!

825
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:39,152
- I'm alive.

826
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:42,850
Here I'm very much alive.

827
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:50,518
In this "Quantum Hell" you
have unleashed,

828
01:09:50,551 --> 01:09:54,418
I'm every bit as real
as you are sweetheart.

829
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:58,251
- The experiment. It failed?

830
01:09:58,284 --> 01:09:59,116
Oh God.

831
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:01,650
- Why would you think that?

832
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,650
- Crazy bitch.

833
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:08,583
(banging on door)

834
01:10:08,617 --> 01:10:09,949
Brad! Brad! Wake up man.

835
01:10:09,983 --> 01:10:11,849
Wake the fuck up.

836
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:13,650
Brad! Fuck!

837
01:10:13,684 --> 01:10:16,882
(ominous music)

838
01:10:16,915 --> 01:10:21,815
- What the fuck are you
yelling about?

839
01:10:21,848 --> 01:10:27,082
- Fuck.

840
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:33,449
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

841
01:10:33,482 --> 01:10:35,815
(slapping face)

842
01:10:35,848 --> 01:10:39,516
(speaking other language)

843
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:41,616
(creature grunting)

844
01:10:41,649 --> 01:10:44,382
(Luke screams)

845
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:53,281
(ominous music)

846
01:11:12,447 --> 01:11:15,414
(thunder crashing)

847
01:11:19,048 --> 01:11:22,314
- What the hell?

848
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,047
- Could be.

849
01:11:26,514 --> 01:11:37,080
Or any one of an infinite
number of dimensions.

850
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,812
- Sophie, about earlier, I'm
sorry I was so aggressive.

851
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:46,313
- Do you like me?

852
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,012
- Yes. I do like you, Sophie.

853
01:11:58,844 --> 01:11:59,978
- Do you love me?

854
01:12:01,978 --> 01:12:03,112
- I think so.

855
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:06,512
- Do you want to finish what
you started?

856
01:12:09,612 --> 01:12:11,877
(thunder crashes)

857
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,178
- Look out the window.

858
01:12:14,211 --> 01:12:15,977
The experiment --
it must have worked.

859
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:19,211
- Of course it did,
with the help of Cerno

860
01:12:20,345 --> 01:12:21,744
- Cerno?

861
01:12:21,778 --> 01:12:22,877
Sister?

862
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:26,444
- Stupid little Sophie.

863
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:31,311
Cerno used her and
fooled you all.

864
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:35,809
- Sophie?

865
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,577
What is wrong with you?

866
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:40,044
What are you talking about?

867
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:41,144
- For starters,

868
01:12:43,244 --> 01:12:45,977
my name is not Sophie.

869
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:51,077
Soooopheeeee.

870
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:53,977
How pedestrian.

871
01:12:54,476 --> 01:12:59,410
My name is Katia and now
for the finale.

872
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:02,976
I will be ending your
pathetic life.

873
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:04,609
It's faster if you go
with it, girl.

874
01:13:04,642 --> 01:13:06,575
(Ivanna screams)

875
01:13:06,609 --> 01:13:07,709
- Fuck you bitch!

876
01:13:07,742 --> 01:13:08,575
(lamp shatters)

877
01:13:08,609 --> 01:13:10,709
- Whooo
You go girl!

878
01:13:10,742 --> 01:13:12,575
Give it to me baby.

879
01:13:12,609 --> 01:13:14,409
Give it to me baby, come on.

880
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:15,742
Come one girl.

881
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:17,042
Whooooohoooo.

882
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:23,309
- How stupid of me to think
this is Hell.

883
01:13:25,475 --> 01:13:26,641
- Hell?

884
01:13:26,675 --> 01:13:27,542
- Fuck.

885
01:13:28,975 --> 01:13:32,840
- I never believed in hell,
or heaven.

886
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:37,975
I may need to reevaluate
my beliefs.

887
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:40,207
- My God!

888
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:42,840
- Look man, can we move
past this skin thing?

889
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:45,541
- Does it hurt?

890
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:48,141
- Like a Mother Fucker!

891
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,308
Unless I am smoking this Kush.

892
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:54,440
It really seems to take
the edge off?

893
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,107
But is it really Kush?

894
01:13:58,207 --> 01:13:59,907
Is any of this really real?

895
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:03,340
Are you?

896
01:14:03,373 --> 01:14:06,640
Maybe I shouldn't think
about it that hard,

897
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:07,873
you know what I mean?

898
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,040
Here man.

899
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,773
- No thanks.

900
01:14:22,206 --> 01:14:24,272
Look man, the experiment!

901
01:14:24,306 --> 01:14:25,139
It worked.

902
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,939
Do you realize where we are?

903
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:30,072
- We've all been duped, Luke.

904
01:14:30,506 --> 01:14:32,205
- We need to get down
to the lab.

905
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,172
- Already been down there.

906
01:14:34,205 --> 01:14:38,205
Well, down there in regards
to this dimension down there,

907
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,838
back on the flip side they
are hauling off bodies.

908
01:14:41,872 --> 01:14:43,306
- What?

909
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:45,005
- Well, I guess I should
get down to it.

910
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:46,139
- To what?

911
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:48,105
- Killing you,

912
01:14:49,838 --> 01:14:51,705
the you here.

913
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,772
You, you?

914
01:14:54,538 --> 01:14:55,438
You get it?

915
01:14:57,571 --> 01:15:00,937
You're not very comfortable
with yourself are you?

916
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:02,937
Things are better when you die.

917
01:15:03,771 --> 01:15:05,271
Trust me.

918
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:06,204
Let me see?

919
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:12,504
Oh yeah!

920
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:14,137
Fuck yeah!

921
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,504
FUCK YEAH!

922
01:15:18,537 --> 01:15:21,370
(sword whooshes)

923
01:15:22,437 --> 01:15:23,337
Luke,

924
01:15:24,237 --> 01:15:25,103
Luke

925
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:30,137
Luke.

926
01:15:34,469 --> 01:15:35,736
(Ivanna screams)

927
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,636
(Brad Scream)

928
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,236
(blood squelching)

929
01:15:38,269 --> 01:15:42,236
- We're gonna get
the fuck out here.

930
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:50,369
Fuck. Ivanna.

931
01:15:50,568 --> 01:15:53,269
(Brad panting)

932
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:56,902
OOOOOOOOuchhh!

933
01:15:56,935 --> 01:15:59,835
(Brad screams)

934
01:16:08,568 --> 01:16:11,101
- Sophie? Katia?
Whoever the fuck you are,

935
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,769
you are a fucking cunt!

936
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,834
- Oh? You think you are upset?

937
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:18,035
I wanna wipe that look
off your face, mate,

938
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:22,267
however you die here, you
are going to stay that way.

939
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:31,000
- Shit! Fuck!

940
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:34,034
(Luke grunting)

941
01:16:54,466 --> 01:16:57,266
(Cerno clapping)

942
01:16:58,533 --> 01:16:59,767
- Well done!

943
01:17:00,565 --> 01:17:02,099
Well done indeed!

944
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:06,166
I like the power of death.

945
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:09,932
It's effective, efficiante
and most of all,

946
01:17:09,966 --> 01:17:11,265
it's entertaining.

947
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:15,265
Honestly, I didn't
think you had it in you.

948
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:16,499
Bravo!

949
01:17:16,532 --> 01:17:18,332
- You son of a bitch!
What did you do?

950
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:22,198
- Just fulfilling my end
of a clandestine contract.

951
01:17:25,732 --> 01:17:29,798
No wheelchair needed here
in the Quantum Realm.

952
01:17:30,598 --> 01:17:31,498
- Fuck?

953
01:17:32,431 --> 01:17:33,331
This--

954
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:36,865
I get it!

955
01:17:36,898 --> 01:17:38,798
- What,
you thought you could win?

956
01:17:39,631 --> 01:17:43,698
My dear boy, it's not
about winning or losing.

957
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:47,131
It's much too deep for you
to comprehend.

958
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:50,298
- No, NO!

959
01:17:51,031 --> 01:17:52,563
You're not going to
fuck with me head Cerno.

960
01:17:52,597 --> 01:17:53,497
I'm here.

961
01:17:54,665 --> 01:17:57,497
I'm here.
And you're going to pay.

962
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:01,797
- Somehow I don't think so.

963
01:18:02,996 --> 01:18:06,297
Here, my friend,
reality is fluid.

964
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,063
Whatever you think,
therefore you are.

965
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:15,130
Of course I have been doing
most of your thinking for you.

966
01:18:15,163 --> 01:18:17,562
- Once you crossed into
this dimension,

967
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:23,095
I used Sophie's psychic link
to manifest this environment.

968
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:25,396
- You think I don't get
the simulacrum?

969
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:26,329
Me?

970
01:18:27,496 --> 01:18:30,429
You think that makes you smart,
Cernovich?

971
01:18:30,462 --> 01:18:33,329
- Your combined memories and
perception of this building

972
01:18:33,362 --> 01:18:37,262
manifested here in this
dimension,

973
01:18:38,162 --> 01:18:40,295
all from your own minds.

974
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:43,328
Incredible thing to see.

975
01:18:44,629 --> 01:18:47,228
With a few tweaks of my own.

976
01:18:48,028 --> 01:18:50,094
- That's right baby!

977
01:18:50,128 --> 01:18:53,861
Now we'll be here,
together here forever.

978
01:18:53,894 --> 01:18:55,595
Yeah.

979
01:18:55,628 --> 01:18:56,161
(Kathy laughing)

980
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:58,228
- No! No, no, no!

981
01:19:01,827 --> 01:19:03,894
- It is quite fascinating.

982
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:08,027
Each of you, even you,

983
01:19:09,294 --> 01:19:13,595
clinging you minds to
the reality once accupied.

984
01:19:14,193 --> 01:19:17,427
If you only knew what was
possible here?

985
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,294
I can make it permanent.

986
01:19:21,427 --> 01:19:24,960
Something you can't possibly
understand.

987
01:19:26,993 --> 01:19:31,560
Check and mate, Luke.

988
01:19:31,594 --> 01:19:34,126
- Luke, you still have a
chance. Get to the lab.

989
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:35,793
- Yeah she's right.

990
01:19:35,825 --> 01:19:38,925
If you can get back to our
dimension without dying here.

991
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:42,527
(Brad laughs)

992
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:50,059
- (Cerno laughs)

993
01:19:51,026 --> 01:19:54,526
You're all feeble
earth dwellers.

994
01:19:55,693 --> 01:19:57,425
Enjoy your fate.

995
01:19:57,458 --> 01:20:00,158
(creepy music)

996
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:12,025
(all laughing)

997
01:20:46,922 --> 01:20:48,323
- (gasping) This is impossible.

998
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:51,557
- Bullocks!
Didn't he see that one coming.

999
01:20:52,457 --> 01:20:55,889
- I am afraid I can not
allow you to go back, Luke.

1000
01:20:55,922 --> 01:20:56,856
- What?

1001
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:02,023
- I currently serve a master
with very a specific appetite.

1002
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:05,155
You are a very sick
person, Luke.

1003
01:21:05,922 --> 01:21:09,188
Those pleasures,
those wicked delights,

1004
01:21:09,921 --> 01:21:11,722
they leave a stain on your soul.

1005
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:15,490
One my master finds quite
delectable.

1006
01:21:15,523 --> 01:21:17,988
- What in the fuck are you
talking about?

1007
01:21:25,888 --> 01:21:27,988
- There is power in the blood.

1008
01:21:29,354 --> 01:21:32,954
Blood, lust, sacrifice,
betrayal, murder--

1009
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:35,354
each one of you sinners.

1010
01:21:35,388 --> 01:21:38,054
You gave it all up for
the flesh.

1011
01:21:38,887 --> 01:21:40,321
You have no protection.

1012
01:21:41,121 --> 01:21:43,655
So now, once you're dead,

1013
01:21:44,588 --> 01:21:47,887
are just like food for
the master of this realm.

1014
01:21:48,854 --> 01:21:50,353
Our Glorious One.

1015
01:21:51,755 --> 01:21:54,388
These Quantum Devils,

1016
01:21:55,287 --> 01:21:56,220
if you will.

1017
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,819
I will leave you to
your devices.

1018
01:22:07,986 --> 01:22:10,553
I hope you find the house to
your liking,

1019
01:22:10,587 --> 01:22:13,520
because you are going to be
here for a very long time.

1020
01:22:14,754 --> 01:22:16,152
- No, I'm not dead!

1021
01:22:16,919 --> 01:22:18,052
Not yet!

1022
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,019
Not if I kill you first!

1023
01:22:25,852 --> 01:22:27,019
- I see.

1024
01:22:29,052 --> 01:22:31,286
Are you challenging me
to a duel?

1025
01:22:31,318 --> 01:22:33,519
- I am going to fuck you up,
asshole!

1026
01:22:33,552 --> 01:22:35,985
- Well,
I will take that as a yes!

1027
01:22:36,753 --> 01:22:37,885
Challenge accepted!

1028
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:40,917
(snaps fingers)

1029
01:22:45,784 --> 01:22:47,018
- Gentlemen.

1030
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:50,784
- My dear fellow, I insist.

1031
01:22:59,051 --> 01:23:02,851
- Gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire,

1032
01:23:02,884 --> 01:23:05,284
I will toss a coin in the air.

1033
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,585
As the offended party,

1034
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,451
it is Mr. Matthews's
choice to call the toss.

1035
01:23:11,485 --> 01:23:13,451
Is that agreeable to
both of you?

1036
01:23:15,217 --> 01:23:17,150
What is your call, Mr. Matthews?

1037
01:23:18,684 --> 01:23:19,783
- Heads.

1038
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:25,350
- It is heads.

1039
01:23:25,384 --> 01:23:28,049
Mr. Matthews will have
the first fire.

1040
01:23:28,082 --> 01:23:30,484
Gentlemen, take your ground.

1041
01:23:30,517 --> 01:23:33,716
(others clapping)

1042
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,849
One...

1043
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:36,815
two...

1044
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:38,449
three...

1045
01:23:38,483 --> 01:23:39,683
four...

1046
01:23:39,716 --> 01:23:40,849
five...

1047
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:42,349
six...

1048
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:43,616
seven...

1049
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:44,849
eight...

1050
01:23:44,882 --> 01:23:46,416
nine...

1051
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:47,148
ten.

1052
01:23:47,882 --> 01:23:52,383
Lord Cerno, are you ready to
receive Mr. Matthews fire?

1053
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:53,316
- Always!

1054
01:23:54,349 --> 01:23:57,115
- Mr. Matthews cock your pistol.

1055
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:00,115
(pistols fizzes)

1056
01:24:00,148 --> 01:24:03,814
(all cheer and laugh)

1057
01:24:07,015 --> 01:24:08,115
- What a shame.

1058
01:24:08,148 --> 01:24:10,315
His pistol must be faulty.

1059
01:24:10,348 --> 01:24:12,682
- No! No! I need another one.

1060
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:13,947
- I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews,

1061
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,913
but you must first stand
your ground,

1062
01:24:15,947 --> 01:24:18,248
and allow Lord Cerno his
turn to fire.

1063
01:24:18,282 --> 01:24:21,582
Mr. Matthews, are you ready
to receive Lord Cerno's fire?

1064
01:24:21,614 --> 01:24:23,014
- No, you gave me a bad gun.

1065
01:24:23,047 --> 01:24:24,481
- You both had equal choice.

1066
01:24:24,514 --> 01:24:26,748
Is your pistol cocked,
Lord Cerno?

1067
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:28,147
- Oh yes.

1068
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,980
- Then prepare to fire.

1069
01:24:30,014 --> 01:24:33,179
(foreboding music)

1070
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:39,013
(pistol fires)

1071
01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:45,146
(all clapping)

1072
01:24:50,347 --> 01:24:53,580
- Fuck. Oh, you fucking liar!

1073
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:59,747
I can't believe this,
this is not possible!

1074
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:01,580
- You keep saying that?

1075
01:25:01,613 --> 01:25:04,811
I can tell you one thing that
is certain, Mr. Matthews.

1076
01:25:04,845 --> 01:25:10,313
Here in the quantum realm,
reality is a lot like

1077
01:25:10,346 --> 01:25:13,313
It is only as real as you
believe it is.

1078
01:25:13,346 --> 01:25:16,545
Unless of course I make it real.

1079
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,078
And that is the key.

1080
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:27,178
You lack conviction,
you're weak, Mr. Matthews.

1081
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:43,944
(ground rumbling)

1082
01:25:46,076 --> 01:25:47,511
(thunder crashes)

1083
01:25:47,544 --> 01:25:50,244
(women scream)

1084
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:00,876
- Barada! What an entrance!

1085
01:26:01,543 --> 01:26:03,211
Sic semper tyrannis!

1086
01:26:03,244 --> 01:26:09,710
- Enough of the useless
banter Huuuuummman!

1087
01:26:09,744 --> 01:26:12,210
- Let's get down to
it, shall we, old chap?

1088
01:26:12,243 --> 01:26:15,477
As you know I have fulfilled
my part of our contract.

1089
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:22,509
- I'm afraid I must alter
our agreement.

1090
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,875
- We have a deal, no?

1091
01:26:24,908 --> 01:26:27,075
- Not if you are dead.

1092
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:31,942
(Cerno laughing)

1093
01:26:31,975 --> 01:26:33,908
- What is this?

1094
01:26:33,942 --> 01:26:35,676
(thunder crashes)

1095
01:26:35,709 --> 01:26:37,074
WHAT IS THIS!!

1096
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:40,109
- You see,
I am a quick study, Barada.

1097
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:45,242
- Knowledge does not make
you a god, talking monkey.

1098
01:26:45,276 --> 01:26:49,874
- No, being a god
makes me a god!

1099
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:55,608
Now about our agreement.

1100
01:26:56,575 --> 01:26:59,973
- Enough parlor tricks,
Professor!

1101
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:02,608
- You should consider
the future Barada.

1102
01:27:02,642 --> 01:27:06,308
Once I rule this realm I will
restructure its hierarchy.

1103
01:27:07,074 --> 01:27:10,174
(Barada laughing)

1104
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:15,274
- Do you think you are
the first?

1105
01:27:15,307 --> 01:27:19,207
- Of course not,
but I will be the last.

1106
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,972
(Barada laughing)

1107
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:28,740
- Very well, human!

1108
01:27:28,772 --> 01:27:32,374
I declare our contract is
fulfilled.

1109
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:34,839
QUANTUM MERUIT.

1110
01:27:35,473 --> 01:27:37,539
- Now, my payment.

1111
01:27:38,606 --> 01:27:39,506
Tell me.
- (unintelligible)

1112
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:43,506
- And nothing less. It must end.

1113
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:45,904
- Done.

1114
01:27:45,938 --> 01:27:49,804
(Cerno sinister laughter)

1115
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:58,472
(drink shaking)

1116
01:27:58,505 --> 01:27:59,405
- Yes!

1117
01:28:23,437 --> 01:28:27,638
- Heavenly Klaatu,
simply heavenly.

1118
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:30,437
(glasses clink)

1119
01:28:32,837 --> 01:28:34,802
- Are we happy boss?

1120
01:28:34,836 --> 01:28:38,237
- Oh yes Klaatu, yes indeed.

1121
01:28:39,836 --> 01:28:42,802
(ominous music)

1122
01:28:59,303 --> 01:29:02,103
(zipper closing)

1123
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:12,335
- Keep it close, Klaatu.

1124
01:29:12,369 --> 01:29:14,768
I have no idea how long
this will last.

1125
01:29:15,369 --> 01:29:18,002
Any word from our headquarters?

1126
01:29:18,035 --> 01:29:19,135
- (Klaatu speaks in foreign
language)

1127
01:29:23,636 --> 01:29:25,235
- Sir, we have TEXAS on
the sat phone for you.

1128
01:29:25,269 --> 01:29:27,369
- I'll take it in the car,
thank you.

1129
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:32,168
- Sir

1130
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:40,334
- Hello?

1131
01:29:40,368 --> 01:29:41,234
Heinrich?

1132
01:29:42,434 --> 01:29:43,301
Heinrich?

1133
01:29:44,334 --> 01:29:46,368
Heinrich, take off
those ridiculous goggles

1134
01:29:46,401 --> 01:29:47,799
and look at me when I
talk to you.

1135
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:49,534
- Yes, Father, sorry.

1136
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:52,766
I'm fine.

1137
01:29:52,799 --> 01:29:54,201
How is it there?

1138
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:57,533
- Unlike what I am hearing
from Texas,

1139
01:29:57,567 --> 01:30:00,367
this experiment was a
rousing success.

1140
01:30:01,267 --> 01:30:04,700
- And what of the inhabitants
of that dimension?

1141
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,567
The old dead gods.

1142
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,400
- They are of no concern.

1143
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:12,133
As long as we use the Quantum
Tanks, they can not touch us.

1144
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:14,066
- I'm not quite that far along.

1145
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:16,566
There are variables.

1146
01:30:16,599 --> 01:30:19,000
They are trying to stop me.

1147
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:21,266
- Mind your indulgences.

1148
01:30:26,032 --> 01:30:27,999
- Destination sir?

1149
01:30:28,032 --> 01:30:29,332
- The airport, Larry.

1150
01:30:31,733 --> 01:30:34,831
(window whirring)

1151
01:30:46,797 --> 01:30:48,032
- Chop, chop.

1152
01:30:48,065 --> 01:30:49,231
- [Larry] Yes sir.

1153
01:30:50,998 --> 01:30:53,864
(car rumbles)
