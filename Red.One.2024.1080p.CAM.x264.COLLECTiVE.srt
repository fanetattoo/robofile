1
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,083
Oh, sorry I'm going to--

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,333
Excuse me.

3
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,708
What is this? Like I
said, we're being played.

4
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,041
Now pay up.

5
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,291
How'd you even find this stuff?

6
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,458
I can find anything or anyone.

7
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:31,958
Then why can't you find your dad?

8
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,791
Hilarious, dude.

9
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:39,166
Look, I don't know what all this
stuff is, but Santa is coming tonight.

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,125
Okay, can we talk
about that for a minute?

11
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:41,750
Jack O'Malley.

12
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,458
Kids could host us.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:46,750
Not you.

14
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,250
Not you.

15
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,666
What are you doing, pal?

16
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,708
Look, we love having
you here for the holidays.

17
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,916
But what are you telling your cousins?

18
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,708
The cold hard truth.

19
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,875
Cold hard truth.

20
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,291
Jack, these are presents, yes.

21
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:05,958
But these aren't Santa's presents.

22
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,250
Right. Because Santa
Claus hasn't been here yet.

23
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,750
It's Christmas Eve. He's coming tonight.

24
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,750
He's coming here. To this house. Tonight.

25
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,458
Tonight. That's what you're telling him.

26
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,583
That's what I'm telling you.

27
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,833
And he's also going to
every other house in the world.

28
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,375
On the same night, using
fine reindeer for transportation.

29
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,166
Yes, Jack.

30
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,041
And what fuels a fine reindeer, exactly?

31
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:34,666
For carrots?

32
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,833
Okay, look, I don't
know exactly how it works.

33
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:43,375
All I know is, when we wake up
tomorrow, Santa will have been here.

34
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,750
[Sigh]

35
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,541
Alright, let's go.

36
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,916
You don't want to get
on the naughty list, do you?

37
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,458
Honestly Uncle Rick,
I'm not that worried about it.

38
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,041
Christine, triple shot of maracano.

39
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:47,125
Jack, go madly. I don't believe it.

40
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,416
Lenny, you missed me.

41
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,333
Where's my money?

42
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm getting you your money. I
told you I'm going to get you your money.

43
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,750
I'm on a job right now.

44
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,916
In fact, I'm planning on doubling it.

45
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,833
Still got Morris at plus 300.

46
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,833
Morris, that's stiff.

47
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,458
Put me down for 25, Jack.

48
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,375
You got a lot of balls, Uncle Riley.

49
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,875
I know, brains too. It
doesn't seem fair. It doesn't.

50
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:56,750
Fire. Fire.

51
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,750
What are you looking at?

52
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Ultimate Vampire
Assassin 4 for the Switch. Got it.

53
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you going to write that now?

54
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,541
No. Still driving.

55
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,625
Hey, Fred. Got a 5'11" male grown up

56
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,625
hovering by the scent
of candles. Keep an eye out.

57
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,333
Copy, Chief. I got eye on him.

58
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,708
Hi, Santa. We made cookies for you.

59
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,208
Thank you.

60
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,750
John, what do you
have to do with Snickerdoodle?

61
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,750
I love Snickerdoodle. How do you know?

62
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,291
I made them myself. I hope.

63
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,166
You know what? I don't mean
it to talk to you guys. Come here.

64
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,666
We're live. Yo, it's your boy, Steve Stu.

65
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,416
And we're here at Christmas at
the mall with the boy, the dog, Santa.

66
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,125
And we're going to get
him to put on a Stu Crew T-shirt.

67
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,750
Sir, you can't cut the line.

68
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,500
Ah, what's the matter, big guy?

69
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,833
You know, I show some
Christmas love to the bee.

70
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,083
These kids have been waiting a long time.

71
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,208
Look, man. It'll
take two minutes. He puts

72
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,291
on the shirt and he
says, "Now we beat them."

73
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:18,208
Sir, I'm a big deal.
I have over 3,000 followers.

74
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,958
I'm going to make you boy
famous. You just got to put the shirt on.

75
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,500
He's already quite famous.

76
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,458
No, don't be a total.

77
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,125
Sir, you can't cut the line.

78
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,125
I made myself clear.

79
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,333
Yes, exactly.

80
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,833
Now I wish you a Merry Christmas.

81
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,333
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to go.

82
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,583
Now, you guys have a very
important appointment with Santa.

83
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,208
Man, I needed that. It's so
important to get out and talk to the kids.

84
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,583
Best part of the job.

85
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,500
Nothing like a crowded
mall two days before Christmas.

86
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,750
No, Santa Man, Merry Christmas.

87
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,750
Merry Christmas, pal.

88
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,750
Tell me you're not going to miss this.

89
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,791
God! What do you mean
you're scold out of a Santa's oil?

90
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,666
I'm going to bash someone's skull in.

91
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,958
I'm not going to miss this.

92
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,416
I'm approaching ground
floor. Let's heat up ice breaker.

93
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,125
Ready? Secondary array.

94
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,208
Under 80 degrees, ready? Go.

95
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,125
Copy that. Red wind is on the move.

96
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,791
Vampire access before it's hot this year.

97
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Thank you, Jennifer.

98
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:30,708
Sure thing, Red.

99
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,333
You got any milk
up there? Of course I do.

100
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,750
I always love coming.

101
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,750
I think we have time
to stop for a cheesesteak.

102
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,750
Hopefully the same without you, Cal.

103
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,666
It'll be exactly the same without me.

104
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,416
I'm just covered in bait in the butt.

105
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,375
General?

106
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,375
Red.

107
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,708
Good to see you.

108
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,791
Successful excursion?

109
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,666
Yes, sir.

110
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,583
The mall at Christmas
time is like oxygen for me.

111
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:26,791
Thank you.

112
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,041
Evening, ladies.

113
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:49,250
What are you so excited about?

114
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,541
Of course, my boyfriend's here.

115
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,750
[laughs]

116
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,791
I hate girls.

117
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,166
Okay, okay.

118
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,583
Of course I didn't forget.

119
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,541
Yes, I brought extra.

120
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,416
It was all right.

121
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,875
Cal!

122
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Come on, man.

123
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,083
Clock ticket.

124
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,916
Red 1, you are clear for takeoff.

125
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:53,916
All right, ladies.

126
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,791
Let's go home.

127
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,000
Thanks for the effort, fellas.

128
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,333
See you next year.

129
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,166
Come on, man!

130
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:23,541
Go ahead.

131
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,083
I got it.

132
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,291
I don't know what
the hell it is, but I got it.

133
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,250
Something gorgeous.

134
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,208
Well, why don't you
send something my way first?

135
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,416
Wiring the first up now,
the rest, and the business verified.

136
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,291
Glad you're doing business with me.

137
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:41,208
Yes!

138
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,250
Yes!

139
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,583
Yes!

140
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:46,458
No.

141
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:48,500
No.

142
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:49,291
No!

143
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,750
Oh, wow, my God!

144
00:14:54,791 --> 00:15:24,333
Home sweet home.

145
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,625
Oh, yes!

146
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,875
[inaudible]

147
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,625
Great.

148
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,250
Welcome back.

149
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,041
Thank you.

150
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,416
Where's the missus?

151
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,166
I'm right here.

152
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,208
The liver hole was a half hour ago.

153
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,375
Larry, this is Villenden Bermuda.

154
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:30,708
[inaudible]

155
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,583
Garcia, welcome back, chief.

156
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,125
What did I miss?

157
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:36,833
Nothing.

158
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,166
Everyone's working.

159
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,541
There's a bottleneck in ribbons.

160
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,875
Phil is blaming rapids.

161
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,416
Rapids says Phil is being over-dramatic.

162
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,000
Everybody's feeling the heat.

163
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:45,750
All right,
I'll talk to him.

164
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,166
Please, Phil's driving everybody nuts.

165
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,458
Phil ribbons is having a total meltdown.

166
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,625
Maybe it's time to find
a less stressful spot for Phil.

167
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,250
I don't know, tinsel?

168
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,875
Phil, out of ribbons?

169
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:58,791
Just a thought.

170
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,583
What about dog named ribbons?

171
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:01,708
Definitely.

172
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:08,250
495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500.

173
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,083
In five minutes, not bad.

174
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,416
Getting warmed up.

175
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,750
All right, I'm going to
run the simulation model on Belgium

176
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,666
and Holland again just to be safe.

177
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,750
Thank you, sweetie.

178
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
All right, if you need me, yell.

179
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,250
Hey, yell.

180
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,291
Jump in there.

181
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,625
Get them ready, okay?

182
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,041
Go on a showtime.

183
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:25,291
Smell.

184
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:25,958
We'll do.

185
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:43,791
Hey, boss.

186
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,000
Come.

187
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:57,791
Give me your spot, huh?

188
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:58,750
Got it.

189
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:12,708
Tell me why.

190
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,333
Time for a change, Nick.

191
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:16,833
It's like I told you.

192
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,666
Yeah, I heard you.

193
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,541
And I'll respect your
decision, but I want to know why.

194
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,250
Let's go heavy.

195
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:22,708
Yeah.

196
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,125
Yeah.

197
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,666
Looking strong.

198
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,291
We work for the kids, Kel.

199
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:33,625
We do it for them.

200
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,416
And I know you love that.

201
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:36,708
You live for that.

202
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,333
So what's going on here?

203
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,333
I love the kids.

204
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,791
It's the grown-ups that are killing me.

205
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,750
Go on.

206
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:51,708
The list.

207
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:52,750
What about the list?

208
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,250
We're up almost 22% year over year.

209
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,458
I'm aware of the numbers, Kel.

210
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,333
What are you getting at?

211
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,333
For the first time ever, more
people are on the naughty list than not.

212
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,833
And it's like they don't even care.

213
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,916
So much bad behavior out there.

214
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,333
Everywhere you look.

215
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,541
You say it all the time, Nick.

216
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,750
We choose every day who we want to be.

217
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,250
With big decisions and little ones.

218
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,125
And every one of them matters.

219
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,375
But I look around and
they act like none of it matters.

220
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,125
If nothing matters to them, it
seems to me they need us now more than ever.

221
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,458
That's why there's only one you.

222
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,500
And no one with my
doubts should be so close to you.

223
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,625
You need somebody
younger, someone 300 years

224
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,000
old in their prime
who wants to change things.

225
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,750
Not our job to change people, Kel.

226
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,625
People change themselves.

227
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,208
We've just shown that we believe in them.

228
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,458
All of them.

229
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
Because we know who they really are.

230
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:06,750
Down deep.

231
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:14,125
We know that somewhere inside every
lost grown-up is the kid they once were.

232
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,208
Our gift is that we can see them.

233
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,208
Even when they can't.

234
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,416
We work for the kids, Kel.

235
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,958
Even when they're not kids anymore.

236
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm just having a
really hard time seeing it.

237
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,125
And that's why.

238
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:41,833
What's out of cooking?

239
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:44,750
The answer to everything.

240
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,666
Got a car book?

241
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,208
You know, I burn a little burn.

242
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,958
You burn 430 million
calories every Christmas Eve.

243
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,416
Yes, I know.

244
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:55,791
One last ride.

245
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,375
One last ride.

Hey Jeff, looks like we got a few
more of them too. What's going on up there?

Jeff? Jeff, do you copy?

Who's with Red?
Arthur, is he still with you?

260
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,500
Negative, Chief.

261
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,000
Can you hear him?

262
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,416
Not in the gym.

263
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,375
Who's with Red?

264
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,083
Moving to human residence?

265
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,708
Bingo, just took over.

266
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:35,375
Bingo!

267
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:36,750
Bingo!

268
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,166
I need eyes on Red now.

269
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,458
Now, we're in negative.

270
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,666
Study negative.

271
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,750
Mr. Two-Hydroponics native.

272
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,583
He's not in the gallery.

273
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:52,875
Logistics negative.

274
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,875
After we're
negative, we're packaging our data.

275
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,250
We're showing you what your name is.

276
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,500
I'm actually making a lot of noise.

277
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,416
I'm going to make a lot of noise.

278
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,125
I'm going to make a lot of noise.

279
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:02,583
Negative.

280
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,250
I'm going to make a lot of noise.

281
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,916
Thank you.

282
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,000
We have a bridge.

283
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:23,541
We have a bridge.

284
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,375
Right here.

285
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,375
Let's see what you're doing.

286
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:27,583
What's your note?

287
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:28,166
Going up.

288
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,000
Can you hear me?

289
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:42,916
Talk green. Talk green.

290
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:43,875
Pull back down.

291
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,166
Over at Snowcat.

292
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:46,541
Hurry north.

293
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:47,916
Copy that.

294
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:48,750

295
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,000
You're alive.

296
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,375
You've turned right on time.

297
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,041
Copy.

Watch him in.

302
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,166
No.

311

What the hell just happened?

312
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,958
There's been a breach, Director.

313
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:41,583
I know.

314
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,583
Red has been taken.

315
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:45,375
What?

316
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:46,583
Where's Cal?

317
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:47,333
Right here.

318
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,666
Cal, what happened?

319
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,833
Who could have done this?

320
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:50,916
Zoe, I don't know.

321
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,416
We were 24 hours to Christmas Eve.

322
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,000
We could ask.

323
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:53,666
I'm well aware.

324
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,291
Okay, okay, let's take a deep breath.

325
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:00,666
Start from the beginning.

326
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,041
They cut a hole in the CF dome

327
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,625
using an atomic plasma torch.

328
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,416
From the footprints, I'd
say there's eight to 10 of them.

329
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:07,916
Human.

330
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,375
They rolled in on
the remote on the snow cat,

331
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,458
but they used it in the version

332
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,875
before they blasted out a year

333
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,416
in the NORAD blind cargo jet.

334
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,416
Good God, Cal.

335
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:16,750
I'm gonna find them, Zoe.

336
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,833
We're gonna work together on this.

337
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,541
We were just told that someone hacked

338
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,625
the intercontinental
seismic surveillance system.

339
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,375
I don't know if it's related,

340
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,750
but if someone knew where to look,

341
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,416
that's the only
vulnerability in the cloaking.

342
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:29,583
Who?

343
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,041
We don't know yet.

344
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,500
The trolls are scouring the web.

345
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,208
Name and address.

346
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,916
They are working on it.

347
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,916
Tell them to work faster.

348
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:37,958
We don't have time for this.

349
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,791
Director, the trolls have a trace.

350
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,166
Patch them in.

351
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,500
What have you got?

352
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,416
We traced the relays.

353
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,500
Looks like the wolf.

354
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:48,458
The wolf.

355
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:49,958
Who the hell is a wolf?

356
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,458
Mercenary, bounty
hunter, works for the highest bidder,

357
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,166
a ghost on the dark web.

358
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,791
FBI has been trying
to recruit him for years,

359
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,041
but he's a freelancer.

360
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,166
He's probably the
best tracker in the world.

361
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:05,166
You guys are legends.

362
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,291
(growling)

363
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:14,416
(grunting)

364
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:20,375
Why?

365
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:21,291
Nice.

366
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,375
Are you in town?

367
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:23,500
It depends.

368
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:24,541
What do you want?

369
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,708
I wish I could do me a
favor and go pick up Dylan.

370
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,583
I'm right, the village is so important.

371
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,333
This isn't a great time for me.

372
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,291
Yeah, me either.

373
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,708
I have two mothers to
be with weakening contractions

374
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,708
and labors that's not
progressing and Craig's out of town.

375
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:36,666
Liv.

376
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,750
Don't we go out in trouble at school?

377
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,916
I just need you to go pick him up

378
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:40,875
and drop him off in my place.

379
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,916
Liv. Jack.

380
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,916
I'm stuck at work and Craig's away,

381
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,625
so just do me a
favor and go pick up your kid.

382
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:53,000
(ominous music)

383
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,791
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

384
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:06,375
Hey buddy.

385
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,875
Hey, you got me, an ice cream.

386
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:12,666
What?

387
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:14,041
No.

388
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,833
I gotta get something in my stomach.

389
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,083
You want a churro?

390
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:19,916
No.

391
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,291
(ominous music)

392
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,500
Hey man, did I get two?

393
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,083
I don't want a churro.

394
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,208
I heard you.

395
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:30,958
Look for me.

396
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,666
So what are they saying you did?

397
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,458
Can't put the school's
attendance records, which I did.

398
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:39,583
I'm glad you agree.

399
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,333
I'd admit that.

400
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:43,958
Thank you, have a good day.

401
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,333
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,583
(ominous music)

403
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,500
The music teacher leaves his computer

404
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,666
open during the fifth period.

405
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,208
He started to ditch science so I could go

406
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,541
and practice guitar, and
I changed it on the computer.

407
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:57,333
Makes sense.

408
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,875
There's this girl in jazz band, Piper.

409
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,541
She started to
ditch with me, but then Kevin.

410
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,416
With Kevin?

411
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,416
My best friend, at least he was.

412
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,208
What'd Kevin do?

413
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,125
Kevin found out I wanted to ditch too,

414
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,750
but he's not even in jazz band.

415
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,166
He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

416
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,958
I was the one hanging out with Piper,

417
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,708
so I'm supposed to go
and change his apps in a present

418
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:18,833
so he can hang out with Piper?

419
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:19,916
Bullshit.

420
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,041
So instead, I gave him three more apps.

421
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,125
Good, send a message.

422
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,041
You got busted and told him as principal.

423
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:27,375
Kevin.

424
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,250
So I slashed the tires on his bike.

425
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,500
And now you're disappointed.

426
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:37,875
I am disappointed.

427
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,250
Look, you're gonna
hack a mainframe into a choir

428
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,250
and you're going through a
back door with no fingerprints.

429
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,583
But more importantly,
the second this kid Kevin knew

430
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,166
when you were
doing, you gotta loose sand.

431
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,625
Never trust anybody, anybody,

432
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,750
and never let
someone get the upper hand up.

433
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:57,416
Because they'll use it.

434
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:09,041
All right, I gotta go practice.

435
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,333
I had this dumb winter
pageant thing tonight for jazz band.

436
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,041
A pageant?

437
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:14,458
Oof.

438
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,625
I know.

439
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,208
I said it was dumb.

440
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,416
Well, good luck.

441
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,583
We're gonna talk like men.

442
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,500
I know.

443
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:27,958
That labor wasn't progressing.

444
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,291
Yeah, it's been dead.

445
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,875
Thanks for picking him up, though.

446
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,375
I don't know what's
going on with him these days.

447
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,083
He's acting out.

448
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:34,916
Yeah.

449
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:36,666
Growing up is tough.

450
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,666
Is that why you're avoiding it?

451
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,083
That's why he's waiting for it.

452
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:40,416
Yeah.

453
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,708
He'd really love to
see you more often, Jack.

454
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,000
I just picked him up.

455
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:46,541
I know.

456
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:47,291
It was really nice.

457
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:48,083
We had a good talk.

458
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,041
He told me about school.

459
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,250
He would love that to happen more often,

460
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,291
is all I'm saying.

461
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,000
I gotta go to work.

462
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:55,250
Okay.

463
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:57,833
Merry Christmas, Jack.

464
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:00,041
Yeah.

465
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,791
Merry Christmas, Jack.

466
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:36,750

I'm just trying to urine this fucking
part of me. No, s BF No, CN (c lake sound)

469
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:27,916
Hi, John.

470
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,458
We know what you did.

471
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:52,291
Her?

472
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,291
We know what you did.

473
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:06,166
Okay, first of all, sorry.

474
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,541
Second, could you be more specific?

475
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,833
Honestly, you could be talking
about 12 different things right now.

476
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:14,208
Who are you working for?

477
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,875
Lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

478
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,666
I work for whoever pays me.

479
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:23,458
You have about 40 seconds to become
helpful before you have a terrible accident.

480
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,541
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

481
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:28,250
Who hired you to find him?

482
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:28,625
I knew.

483
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,541
You know who.

484
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,166
I promise you I don't.

485
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:34,041
If I did, I would tell
you, I'm not a scrupulous person.

486
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:34,875
You can ask anybody.

487
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,208
The intercontinental
seismic surveillance system.

488
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:40,041
Sound familiar?

489
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,791
Yeah, I did that.

490
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,250
It was a weird job.

491
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,833
Somebody was trying to find someone who

492
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,750
was running tests
on some weapons systems in

493
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,375
the Arctic, and I found the location.

494
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:53,833
And I walked.

495
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:54,708
By who?

496
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:55,833
I don't know.

497
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,541
I'm telling you, all the
communication is encrypted and untraceable.

498
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,750
That's how it's supposed to be.

499
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,500
So if someone like you
shows up, I don't have any answers.

500
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,791
Look, I don't ask questions.

501
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,125
I just find people
that no one else can find.

502
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:09,916
It's what I do.

503
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:17,083
You really don't know what you did?

504
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:18,833
I guess not.

505
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,708
I mean, I can tell
you're very upset about it, though.

506
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:28,250
Box him up.

507
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,166
Box me up?

508
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:30,666
Wait, wait.

509
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:31,291
What do you mean?

510
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:31,666
Hey!

[MUSIC PLAYING]

512
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,041
Is this really necessary?

513
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,208
Hello.

514
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:05,125
Who plays?

515
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,208
How long you been here?

516
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,250
M-O-R-A?

517
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,666
Mora, the Mythological
Oversight and Restoration Authority.

518
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:15,041
Come again?

519
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,750
We are the multilateral international

520
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,750
organization responsible
for securing and protecting the

521
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,625
mythological world.

522
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,041
Come with me.

523
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:27,666
Did you say the mythological world?

524
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,250
Yes.

525
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:29,291
Right.

526
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:36,500
So Bigfoot, Loch Ness
Monster, that kind of thing?

527
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:37,875
That kind of thing.

528
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:38,625
OK.

529
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:43,500
So things that don't actually
exist, you guys are responsible for.

530
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:44,833
Got it.

531
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:48,250
Shit!

532
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,166
He knows anything.

533
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,375
He ain't talking to them.

534
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:04,750
All right.

535
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,083
Horseback to the
pen, body back to area 32,

536
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,791
and get the
pumpkin back in the cryo home.

537
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,208
It's down.

538
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,000
Yes, director.

539
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,083
What the hell was that?

540
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,208
The horseman.

541
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,125
We're questioning all the usual suspects.

542
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,083
The headless horseman?

543
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,458
Hey!

544
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,875
What did that taser thing do to my head?

545
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:24,916
It's not a taser.

546
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:25,500
It's an agri-ester.

547
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,541
Just take a deep
breath and have a seat, Jack.

548
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:48,291
What are you doing?

549
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:48,500
What am I doing here?

550

why you're holding the leash and this is how

00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:31,833
I can find you anywhere on earth
your mind until we find him I suggest you get

585
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:32,833
going

586
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:10,375
well this is unfortunate no this is
what needed to be done I sincerely doubt that

587
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,416
you know I know a guy
who's gonna be very upset about this

588
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:27,125
what are you gonna do with that the
world is a mess because they fear nothing

589
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:36,791
I'm going to give them something to
fear I'm going to do in one night which you

590
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:43,666
have failed to do for centuries
and what is that I'm gonna make the world a

591
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,083
better place

592
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:57,541
what are you doing Oh some of your energy

593
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,291
No

594
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:08,583
Now, go to sleep, Nicholas. Go to sleep.

595
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:41,750
What we doing some
last minute Christmas shopping?

596
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:45,291
Gear it up. Grab a
car, something practical.

597
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,166
Let's go.

598
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,708
What the hell just happened?

599
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:43,875
Toy stores.

600
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:47,625
Toy stores what?

601
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,166
The supply closets
are portal stations for

602
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,000
the North Pole
Field Network transit system.

603
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:07,041
I said practical.

604
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,083
Like what a mini man who
wants a practical Hot Wheels.

605
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,708
Also what difference does it make?

606
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:12,625
I gave you a directive.

607
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,708
A directive?

608
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Is that what you think is going on here?

609
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:23,166
I'm telling you now, you better listen
to me because things are about to get real.

610
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,583
How do you adjust to this reality?

611
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:42,583
No, it doesn't work on everything.

612
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:43,791
No, you can't try it.

613
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:44,666
No, you can't drive.

614
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:45,458
No more questions.

615
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:45,875
Now get in.

616
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,625
And be careful with those robots.

617
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,083
So you're like the
bodyguard for Santa Claus

618
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:13,250
and the commander
of the ELF for SAS National

619
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:13,958
Force.

620
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,875
Enforcement,
logistics, and fortification.

621
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:20,083
But as far as you're concerned, it
stands for Extremely Large Department of Law.

622
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:27,041
And that's all you do all year?

623
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,833
Just protect Santa.

624
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:31,500
It's a big job.

625
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:33,000
Sure, sure.

626
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,291
It's one day, all right?

627
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,250
Like it's a big job for one day.

628
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:44,208
We work 364 days a
year because on that one

629
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:47,000
day, we deliver
presents to several billion

630
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,041
individual domiciles across 37 time zones

631
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,666
without ever being
detected by a single human being.

632
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:57,791
We pray, we rehearse every
moment, every stop down to the last gym.

633
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,958
So yeah, it's a lot of work.

634
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,583
364 days?

635
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:03,458
We have bucks a day off.

636
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:09,250
Wouldn't it be easier
if you broke it up, you know?

637
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,958
Like send different teams out
different places, it's more efficient?

638
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,625
No, it doesn't work like that.

639
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,250
He's got to do it all himself.

640
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,208
He doesn't have to.

641
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:16,916
It's his purpose.

642
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:19,041
He's a singular force in the universe.

643
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,208
Okay, so worst case scenario, is there

644
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,666
someone that can step
in for him like a vice Santa?

645
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:24,916
Are you listening to me?

646
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,250
No, no one can do what he does.

647
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:28,750
He knows when you're sleeping.

648
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,208
He knows when you're awake.

649
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:33,541
And he knows that about
every single person on this planet.

650
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,250
He has a list the size of
Rhode Island and he checks it twice.

651
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:40,500
If you were to try to read that
list just once, it would take you a decade.

652
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,583
But he does it twice.

653
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:47,291
And the reason why he's able to do
any of it is because he is Santa Claus.

654
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:48,958
The one and only.

655
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,541
And no one else can execute his mission.

656
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:55,708
Which is to spread cheer, asshole.

657
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:57,708
Good feeling.

658
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,708
And then before the fist.

659
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:04,708
Bring me the weapon.

660
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:49,750
(dramatic music)

661
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,125
Duplication complete.

662
00:50:59,541 --> 00:50:59,833
Good.

663
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,375
Now, let's see if it works.

664
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,583
Who do you have in mind, Mom?

665
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,250
We'll start with
the first name on the list.

666
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:13,291
(dramatic music)

667
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,333
All right, now we're dark.

668
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, it was nice to meet you, Cal.

669
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,958
Good luck with everything.

670
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,958
Thank you so much.

671
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:40,708
I'm just gonna live here now.

672
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,916
Gonna marry her, leave your focus.

673
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:44,291
We gotta find your guy.

674
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:46,666
Not a lot of fun.

675
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:47,708
How are you, Cal?

676
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:50,583
A lot of fun.

677
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,791
As a matter of fact, I won the prize

678
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,875
for most fun gift
wrapper for 183 years in a row.

679
00:51:58,833 --> 00:51:59,500
Well, I take it back.

680
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,708
(dramatic music)

681
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:05,791
I'm gonna show you how to do this.

682
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,416
I would suggest you give it a shot.

683
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,583
You see the worst in everyone, Cal.

684
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:11,333
Let's go and get it.

685
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:13,458
And it's the key to my work.

686
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,000
You can see a person's worst qualities

687
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,458
just by looking at her.

688
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:18,916
You look at this guy.

689
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,750
He's married, but not to her.

690
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,500
That's why he has a tan
mind where his wedding makes you big.

691
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:26,083
This guy's about to screw over that guy.

692
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,375
That's why he's laughing too loud.

693
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,916
And this guy, now he's interested.

694
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:33,791
Why, you ask?

695
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,875
I didn't ask.

696
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,083
Well, I'll tell you.

697
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,041
Shoes, around.

698
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,000
Anyone else at the beach wearing shoes

699
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,833
besides you, me
and him, we're all working.

700
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,958
(dramatic music)

701
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:55,541
Ah, he's a Carmanian get-work.

702
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:57,833
So is that guy and that guy.

703
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,208
You can tell by
the tattoos on their hands.

704
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,000
This is all fascinating.

705
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,666
How about we find the
guy we're actually looking for?

706
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,875
That's the guy we're looking for.

707
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,625
The Carmanians are a security detail.

708
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:10,333
You sure?

709
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:11,416
I'm sure.

710
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,083
Hey, wait, whoa,
whoa, what are you doing?

711
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,333
Going to talk to him.

712
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:20,916
No, no, we gotta go in sideways here.

713
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,666
Remember when I said
they're called death marks?

714
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:24,291
They'll be fine.

715
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,125
(dramatic music)

716
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,958
(dramatic music)

717
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,333
Keep walking.

718
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:36,958
I need to talk to him now.

719
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:38,916
Keep walking.

720
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:40,416
I'm gonna count to five.

721
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:42,666
Damn words.

722
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:43,833
Then you're gonna get hurt.

723
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:44,791
Oh.

724
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:47,250
(dramatic music)

725
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,666
Listen, dickhead, it's Christmas.

726
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,750
So in the Yuletide spirit,
I'm gonna say it one more time.

727
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:02,333
(dramatic music)

728
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:21,208
That was so disturbing.

729
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:23,666
What's this?

730
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:25,500
What the hell, Ted?

731
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:27,041
Just give me a minute, sweetheart.

732
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,250
I gotta talk to these
absolute morons for a second

733
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:31,833
and then we'll go get some boba.

734
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,041
Okay.

735
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,041
Where is he?

736
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:35,625
Who?

737
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,541
You know who?

738
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:37,791
You really wanna do this?

739
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:40,458
I have no idea what you're talking about.

740
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,333
And while I'm enjoying this visit

741
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,791
from the Magic Mike Christmas Brigade,

742
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,750
I got a couple
ladies waiting on boba teas.

743
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:48,875
Come on, come on.

744
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,541
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

745
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:52,125
Before you implode this man's skull

746
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,666
across this heavenly beach.

747
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,250
Can I have a crack at it?

748
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,375
Look, I'm telling you, for
your own health and well-being,

749
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:00,833
I suggest you leave right now.

750
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:03,291
You don't know who I know.

751
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,250
All right, well, you know what I know?

752
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,666
I know you bought
some information yesterday

753
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,750
and paid quite a bit for it.

754
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,208
Coordinates, the Arctic.

755
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:16,416
I know this because
I'm the one who sold it.

756
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:18,291
Yeah.

757
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:22,958
You're the wolf?

758
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:24,625
No.

759
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:26,875
Should I be here?

760
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:29,125
Do you know what
you've done by coming here?

761
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,083
My client is not to be missed.

762
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,000
No, no, no.

763
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,541
Who's the client?

764
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,000
New York?

765
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,083
Much worse.

766
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:35,708
She'll kill us.

767
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,250
She'll kill us all.

768
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,666
Who is it?

769
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:40,083
I can't say her name.

770
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,291
She will hear.

771
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:48,708
Write her name in the sand.

772
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,541
(screams)

773
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,500
(suspenseful music)

774
00:55:58,541 --> 00:55:58,791
Rila?

775
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:00,250
You idiot.

776
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:00,791
Final?

777
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,416
No!

778
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:02,750
Rila?

779
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:03,333
Rila?

780
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,125
(suspenseful music)

781
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:28,833
(growling)

782
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:29,291
Now, now.

783
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:41,291
(growls)

784
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,250
Callum Drift, story
warrior of the North Pole.

785
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,708
Rila, the Christmas witch.

786
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,541
It has been many years.

787
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:03,000
Not enough.

788
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:05,208
Where is he?

789
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,583
He's right here.

790
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,625
Fast asleep.

791
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:12,708
Signal from Commander Drift.

792
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:15,916
Rila, where are you?

793
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,416
(laughs) I need him
back unharmed immediately.

794
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:23,333
It is not to be warrior!

795
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,041
I need M1 team's emotion

796
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,958
to every one of her ancestral haunts.

797
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:28,375
Yes, Director.

798
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,666
What is it you want?

799
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:33,250
The same thing I have always wanted

800
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,250
for hundreds of years.

801
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,583
To make them behave.

802
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,333
The time has come.

803
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:45,125
To punish the naughty of all of them.

804
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,791
Everyone who is on the list.

805
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:51,708
Everyone who has ever been on the list.

806
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,875
From killers to chairwalkers.

807
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:58,333
Anyone who's ever lied or neared.

808
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,333
Anyone who's ever been rude or late.

809
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,791
You're talking about almost everyone.

810
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:07,500
Everyone I see fit!

811
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,208
Tomorrow they will all be punished.

812
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:15,166
And he is going to hell!

813
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,916
(blows raspberry) You
know he doesn't punish people.

814
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:20,416
Step away, warrior.

815
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:22,375
Let him go, witch.

816
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:23,833
I warned you.

817
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,875
And I warned you.

818
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,333
You can't see him yet,

819
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,083
but when you wake
up this Christmas morning,

820
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,125
the world will be much, much nicer.

821
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,625
What in the actual?

822
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:47,083
(buzzer)

823
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,916
Get those teams moving now.

824
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:50,000
(grunts)

825
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:51,791
What the hell was that?

826
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:53,250
What was that?

827
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,791
What the hell was that?

828
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:55,666
Where is she?

829
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:56,916
We gotta get out of here.

830
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,750
I don't know, I'm just a middleman.

831
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,583
I broke into deal.

832
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:02,208
I'm telling you, she did not mess around.

833
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:02,708
Now.

834
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,958
(blows raspberry)

835
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,458
(whistles)

836
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:11,625
(bells ringing)

837
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,333
(whistles)

838
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:21,666
(bells ringing)

839
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:26,291
(whistles)

840
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:26,791
(growls)

841
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:31,958
(growls)

842
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:45,875
(growls) (growls)

843
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:46,208
(gun fires)

844
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,750
(screams)

845
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,083
(gun fires)

846
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:57,083
Sit down, man.

847
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,250
(gun fires)

848
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,541
(gun fires)

849
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:05,125
(gurgles)

850
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,375
(gurgles)

851
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,875
Get him out of here, he's our only lead.

852
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:14,583
Don't let him be nice.

853
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,500
(growls)

854
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:19,791
Come on.

855
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:29,291
(growls)

856
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:29,750
(gun fires)

857
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,500
(growls)

858
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:32,666
(gun fires)

01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:43,708
(gun fires) (growls)

860
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:48,000
(growls)

861
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,458
(grunts)

862
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:54,458

(growls)

880
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:03,333
(growls)

881
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,250
Just gotta rip off their carrots.

882
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,083
I'll remember that next time it comes up.

883
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,500
Wanna give me a hand here?

884
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,458
You'll figure it out.

885
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:23,708
Let me tell you

886
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:25,916
How Christmas ends

887
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,666
I'm sorry, I think you're confusing me

888
01:03:28,666 --> 01:03:29,708
with someone who cares.

889
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,458
Tell Grandma I don't
have time to pick up her meds.

890
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,541
She can take the bus.

891
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:35,000
Goodbye.

892
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,166
Asshole in life.

893
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:42,000
When you're telling me

894
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,875
How you go

895
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:47,250
But you show me

896
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:50,416
Creative is my school track

897
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:55,791
It's the best kind of sorcery I know

898
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,333
(growls)

899
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:08,625
(growls)

900
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,083
It's still here.

901
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:16,375
What do you mean it's still there?

902
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,125
It's supposed to come back to me.

903
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,125
The machine isn't working.

904
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,333
Fix it.

905
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:25,916
Now, or else the next
test will be on one of you.

906
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,250
Yes ma'am.

907
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:33,875
Careful.

908
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:36,750
That's it.

909
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:40,458
She asked the broker.

910
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,375
She really wanted to shut him up.

911
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,291
By the time he thaws
out, he'll be useless to us.

912
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:47,041
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

913
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,208
My guy scanned all
the surveillance footage

914
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,666
of actually a 900 year old ogre

915
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,666
with 13 sons who kill on command.

916
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:05,625
Oh, tracking
shapeshifters isn't a nightmare.

917
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:08,791
She said that she was
gonna punish them all, every level.

918
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,208
I'd be more worried
about what she didn't say.

919
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:13,250
She wasn't negotiating.

920
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,875
Kidnapping with no demands.

921
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:16,250
But usually anyone.

922
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,208
Unfortunately, our
only lead is now an ice cube.

923
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,291
Not pointing any fingers.

924
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:23,541
Carol, not helpful.

925
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,458
Yeah, Carol, not helpful.

926
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:29,541
So what would you normally do?

927
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,791
I mean, normally
I'd be running credit cards,

928
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,583
checking pings our cell phone towers,

929
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,625
trying to build a
footprint, her or associates.

930
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:39,375
Never tracked a witch before.

931
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:41,208
Dated you.

932
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:44,166
Right now, I've dated several witches.

933
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:45,083
What's your point?

934
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,291
Would you have any
footprint that I wouldn't know about

935
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:51,041
because I'm like a regular human being?

936
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:54,958
If you were gonna check
on recent UDM's, what's that?

937
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,041
Unauthorized deployments of magic.

938
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:00,541
A lot of hits.

939
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:01,916
Pretty typical stuff.

940
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,500
A couple of abjurations in Nairobi.

941
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,416
A handful of
divinations in Santiago and New Orleans.

942
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:08,291
No, she's a conjurer.

943
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,750
A pair of conjurations, eight days ago,

944
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:12,791
a few hours apart,

945
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,333
picked up the echo
of the resonator in Germany.

946
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:17,041
The brother.

947
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,083
Who's brother?

948
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:19,875
Nix.

949
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,041
Santa's got a brother?

950
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:22,291
Adopted, yes.

951
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,625
She's working with the brother.

952
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:25,875
We don't know that.

953
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,500
No, but can you think of
a better place to hold a link?

954
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,583
Think about it.

955
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:29,875
It's under a concealment dome

956
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
and Maura has no
jurisdiction because of the treaty.

957
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,125
He doesn't leave and we don't visit.

958
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:34,666
That's the deal.

959
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,666
We've busted and Nix not there.

960
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:37,875
Maura's not going, we're going.

961
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,375
He's never gonna know we're there.

962
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:39,708
How?

963
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,083
T minus 17 hours, director.

964
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,000
Keep me in the loop every step.

965
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,708
In two hours, I bring the
presidents and prime ministers

966
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,375
and kings and queens of
everywhere so they can prepare.

967
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:56,250
Prepare for what?

968
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,708
For the possibility of no Christmas.

969
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,458
Hey, you're never
wondering what an action thing is.

970
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,041
That's not how it works, come on.

971
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,250
Come on.

972
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,083
I'm coming.

973
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
(indistinct chatter)
This is the kind of essential oil.

974
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:45,833
Dylan asked you to
go to his concert tonight

975
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:46,666
and you said no.

976
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:47,458
What?

977
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,250
No, it's not what happened.

978
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:50,833
He actually said I shouldn't go.

979
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:51,583
He said it was gonna be Wayne.

980
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,750
If he didn't want you to go,

981
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:54,916
he wouldn't have brought it up.

982
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:57,458
An actual parent
doesn't need an invitation.

983
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,791
They just go,
whether the kid likes it or not.

984
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,333
That's what parents do.

985
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,666
Well, we both know
that's not my strong suit.

986
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:05,958
Olivia, look, if you wanted me to go,

987
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,291
he should have just asked me.

988
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,000
He's vulnerable, Jack.

989
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,625
He's a kid and he
knows you never show up.

990
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:14,375
Olivia, I'm at work.

991
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,875
What am I supposed to do?

992
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,750
I don't wanna have to
tell you what to do, Jack.

993
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,208
I want you to figure it out on your own

994
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,416
because it's pretty easy.

995
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,500
The concert starts at seven.

996
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,250
Well, I'm not gonna be home by seven.

997
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,000
Just tell Dylan that I--

998
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,791
I'm not gonna be home by seven.

999
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,750
If you wanna tell him
something, do it yourself.

1000
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:30,666
(Jack sighs)

1001
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:31,958
What?

1002
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:33,958
I didn't say anything.

1003
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:43,541
(Jack grunts)

1004
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,583
(Jack grunts)

1005
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,125
Dylan, right?

1006
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:00,125
Yeah.

1007
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:03,208
He's a good kid.

1008
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah, I know he's a good kid.

1009
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,458
(Jack grunts)

1010
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,166
It's not what you think.

1011
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:17,375
His mother and I were never together.

1012
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,458
I mean, I'm his father,
but I've never been his dad.

1013
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,458
She's a doctor now.

1014
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:26,791
She's married to a really
good guy and he is a good dad.

1015
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,083
So the last thing the kid needs is like,

1016
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:32,708
you know, some spare
dad, some generic damn guy

1017
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,125
hanging out with the scum of the earth.

1018
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,500
He's got nothing to offer him, so.

1019
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:38,916
Honestly, the best
thing I can do for the kid

1020
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,875
is keep some
distance so I don't get in the way

1021
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,666
and he's not disappointed all the time.

1022
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:44,375
Uh-huh.

1023
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:47,041
Uh-huh, why?

1024
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,333
I'm just saying that
you're trying not to disappoint him.

1025
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:53,958
Doesn't sound like it's working.

1026
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:15,000
(dramatic music)

1027
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:24,250
Okay, I can't
believe I'm asking this, but

1028
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,333
what's the deal
with Santa and his brother?

1029
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:33,416
(dramatic music)

1030
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,375
They used to work together.

1031
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:36,750
Back in the beginning,

1032
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,750
Red gave gifts to well-behaved children

1033
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,750
and the brother helped
keep track of who they were.

1034
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,916
Then the brother started making lists

1035
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,708
and Red was always
uncomfortable with that.

1036
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,083
And unlike the idea of
wanting lists to misbehave children,

1037
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,875
but the brother became obsessed.

1038
01:10:56,916 --> 01:11:00,583
So you're saying Santa's
brother started the naughty list?

1039
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:02,041
Yes.

1040
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:05,666
They started to
punish the kids who were on it.

1041
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,000
Red was furious.

1042
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:10,208
So he took the list away

1043
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,208
and the brother never forgave him.

1044
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:17,166
He went out on his own,
eventually hooking up with the witch

1045
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,416
who was also in the punishment game,

1046
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:22,458
organized London and
several other naughty territories.

1047
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,458
They were together
for years, but it ended badly.

1048
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,666
Saying his brother had a
name or is it just Santa's brother?

1049
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,875
His name is Krampus.

1050
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,791
(dramatic music)

1051
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:43,833
All right, listen to me.

1052
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,291
I don't know
what's waiting for us in here,

1053
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:48,000
but the brother, the
witch, they're extremely dangerous.

1054
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,458
They're not in the
ways that you're used to.

1055
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,500
If you see them, do not engage.

1056
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,666
So don't pick a fight with the witch.

1057
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,291
Got it.

1058
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,625
If Nick is here, he's
probably being held in the dungeon.

1059
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:58,583
There's a door-round
back that the guard uses.

1060
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:00,166
We're gonna have to
quietly sneak through the courtyard,

1061
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:02,208
pass the
guillotines, break it and head down.

1062
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:04,791
Also, do not touch anything.

1063
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,250
Under any
circumstances, there is much in here

1064
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,625
that is not of the natural world.

1065
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,875
You're human, therefore weak.

1066
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:13,708
So if you need to touch
anything, you need to do it.

1067
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:15,833
Wait a minute.

1068
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:17,541
Are you not human?

1069
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,375
Do I look human?

1070
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,416
(dramatic music)

1071
01:12:52,666 --> 01:13:01,125
(eerie music)

1072
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:04,916
Hey, so listen to me.

1073
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:06,500
Nick, if you don't need me here,

1074
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,666
I might just go back to the car.

1075
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:15,583
Hellhounds.

1076
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:17,333
Hellhounds?

1077
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,166
(eerie music)

1078
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:26,125
(eerie music)

1079
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:26,416
Stand back.

1080
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:30,625
(eerie music)

1081
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,833
Ellen, distract them.

1082
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,541
(eerie music)

1083
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,000
(eerie music)

1084
01:13:52,708 --> 01:14:02,083
(eerie music)

1085
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:20,041
(eerie music) (eerie music)

1086
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:21,958
What'd you do?

1087
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:23,750
We didn't even do anything.

1088
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,166
(eerie music)

1089
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,083
Holy shit.

1090
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,166
Whoa, whoa.

1091
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:39,541
My name is Commander of the ELF.

1092
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:40,458
We are not these.

1093
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,166
Yeah, we're not these.

1094
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:41,833
We're not these.

1095
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,083
(eerie music)

1096
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,250
This was in his pocket.

1097
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,583
All right, I can explain that.

1098
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:50,708
I can explain that.

1099
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:53,500
(thudding)

1100
01:14:57,583 --> 01:15:00,000
I told you not to touch anything.

1101
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,583
It was an innocent mistake.

1102
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:03,250
He tried to steal
a priceless piece of gold

1103
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,416
from the Dark Lord of Winter.

1104
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,750
Not innocent and not a mistake.

1105
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:08,916
Well, who is this old gold

1106
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:11,000
just lying out in an open treasure chest?

1107
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,750
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

1108
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:14,375
Gascom, they leave him gifts.

1109
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,791
You stole from it.

1110
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:18,375
I shouldn't be surprised.

1111
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,208
Is that because I
happen to be on the list?

1112
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:24,750
You disappointed in me too, Cap.

1113
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,500
I have no expectations of you, Jack,

1114
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,541
so I can't be disappointed.

1115
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:37,250
You know, I got problems on my own.

1116
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,333
I owe somebody a lot
of money that I don't have.

1117
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,041
I see this giant
pile of gold sitting there.

1118
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,750
You look at it a certain
way, what choice did I even have?

1119
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,625
You have every choice.

1120
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:49,541
It's all choices.

1121
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:52,041
You don't just
happen to be on the list, Jack.

1122
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:53,000
You put yourself there.

1123
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:56,416
You decide to steal gold.

1124
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,750
You decide to only look out for yourself

1125
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,291
over everyone else on this earth.

1126
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,583
Every one of those
kids who are counting on us.

1127
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,375
Counting on me to do my job.

1128
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:17,958
Nick always says that every decision,

1129
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:20,625
big or small, is an opportunity.

1130
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:26,875
To be nice, to be good, or not.

1131
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:34,750
I was one day away from
retirement, and this happens.

1132
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,458
After 542 years,

1133
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:42,541
I resigned yesterday.

1134
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:44,458
I did.

1135
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:47,833
Why?

1136
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:51,333
I couldn't see it anymore.

1137
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:53,750
Couldn't see why.

1138
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:58,291
Doesn't matter.

1139
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,666
(dramatic music)

1140
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,291
(man yelling)

1141
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:21,833
Is that him?

1142
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:33,208
What are they doing?

1143
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:34,958
(man yelling)

1144
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:37,916
(crowd cheering)

1145
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:39,666
They're playing crapper's snob.

1146
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:42,500
What do you mean, shob?

1147
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,708
It's their first game of crapper's snob.

1148
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,625
Number one defeated,

1149
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,750
is not Christmas!

1150
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:11,833
(man yelling)

1151
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,875
Callum Drift.

1152
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:16,958
Lord grab us.

1153
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,166
The festivities were just beginning,

1154
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,333
but I don't remember inviting you.

1155
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:31,541
You shouldn't be here.

1156
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,916
You know you shouldn't be here,

1157
01:18:35,083 --> 01:18:38,916
and yet where you are, and with a mortal.

1158
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,208
Ah, I'm Jack O'Malley.

1159
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,583
I didn't, I'm not.

1160
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,708
We didn't even, I mean, obviously we,

1161
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:48,041
I just met him today.

1162
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:50,208
The big one was on with this.

1163
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:52,291
And Lord Andrés.

1164
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:54,000
Thank you.

1165
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:57,208
Just what I wanted for Christmas.

1166
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,416
Grab us, I can explain.

1167
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:01,916
He was trying to find him,

1168
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,208
and you thought he would be here.

1169
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,791
Well guess what, Lord Andrés?

1170
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,291
It's not him.

1171
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:19,125
Last night he was taken
from the compound by the witch.

1172
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,250
I know that she was here not long ago.

1173
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,458
Are you accusing me of something?

1174
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:26,375
Taste.

1175
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:29,208
You and she were partners once.

1176
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,833
From in the countryside, the villages.

1177
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:34,041
Punishing people.

1178
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:35,416
Yes.

1179
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,791
But back then she was glorious.

1180
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:44,208
And over the 18 feet
high, the skin of an elephant,

1181
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:47,750
dying in the tear of tails.

1182
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:52,625
And yes, punishing
us to grow this winter.

1183
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:56,208
We had some wonderful times together.

1184
01:19:57,541 --> 01:20:00,541
But I gave up that work, remember.

1185
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:05,666
I spent 700 years menacing the naughty,

1186
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:08,375
trying to scare me to decency.

1187
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,208
I did my part!

1188
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:17,375
The only punishment I can now is for fun.

1189
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:24,250
I'm concerned for
enjoying his headache on Grandpa's lap.

1190
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,250
On Grandpa's lap.

1191
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,291
But today is not Grandpa's lap.

1192
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:29,708
And this house is not his name.

1193
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,833
It is always Grandpa's lap!

1194
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,041
(dramatic music)

1195
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,250
Grandpa's lap!

1196
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:51,583
Why was she here?

1197
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,000
Many years ago she gave me a gift.

1198
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:00,000
She came because she wanted it back.

1199
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,166
A gift, one gift.

1200
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:03,958
The glass cafe.

1201
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:08,125
While it's face, a simple glass logo.

1202
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,666
But its true purpose is notorious.

1203
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:14,166
Tremendously punishing.

1204
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,541
She wants to punish them all.

1205
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,500
The glass cafe is solid, you.

1206
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:23,208
A place for bad wine.

1207
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:27,916
Grandpa's I need to find her.

1208
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:32,708
Let me go.

1209
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:38,583
And why did I do that?

1210
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:43,666
Because we need her.

1211
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,708
Now more than ever we need her.

1212
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:49,791
And now that.

1213
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:53,541
Let me go.

1214
01:21:55,833 --> 01:22:03,625
(dramatic music)

1215
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:08,750
Nordaman, you are not going anywhere.

1216
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,291
You get down and deliver
this message to that morass come.

1217
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,208
There is a price for this intrusion.

1218
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:23,875
Now and forever it belongs to me.

1219
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:27,833
(audience laughing)

1220
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:32,166
So I just walk out of here.

1221
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,000
I suggest you find.

1222
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,625
You learn to love it.

1223
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,125
Take you away.

1224
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:47,791
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1225
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:51,083
Sorry, wait, Lord, Mr. Lord Cremitz.

1226
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:54,708
Um, you and I aren't so different.

1227
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:00,291
We're pretty different,

1228
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:02,250
but I think we
have some things in common.

1229
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:04,541
Do you though?

1230
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:05,166
Yeah.

1231
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:08,208
I mean, you strike me as a
guy that likes to have a good time,

1232
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:09,708
bit of a gambler.

1233
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,208
Well, so am I.

1234
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,416
Now, when we came in here,

1235
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:15,916
my man told me that
he thought he could beat you

1236
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,041
at your game, uh, Cropper slot.

1237
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,708
Now, initially I said, no way,

1238
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,000
but the more I see him getting riled up,

1239
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,125
I'm starting to like my odds.

1240
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,875
So just hear me out.

1241
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,833
If you win, we go
to your dungeon forever.

1242
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,458
If he wins, we walk.

1243
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:38,625
Unless you don't
want him for some reason.

1244
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:40,666
I mean, I get that he's a big guy.

1245
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:42,083
No shame.

1246
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:43,916
Lot of people watching.

1247
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:49,541
(audience laughing)

1248
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:50,250
Emphasis.

1249
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:52,875
I love it.

1250
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,958
(audience laughing)

1251
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:09,291
Sleep or shit, I have to go.

1252
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:11,875
(audience laughing)

1253
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,833
(audience laughing)

1254
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,791
The rules are as follows.

1255
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:24,583
The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

1256
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:27,125
The first to be knocked out or done.

1257
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,166
Leases.

1258
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:35,291
First touch.

1259
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:36,875
That's your.

1260
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,916
(audience laughing)

1261
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:51,791
I really wish there was
another way that we could do this.

1262
01:24:54,583 --> 01:24:55,541
I'm sure you do.

1263
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:57,625
He's still your brother.

1264
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:00,708
And he never gave up on you.

1265
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,166
What would you know about him?

1266
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:04,291
I know him.

1267
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:09,958
Take your best shlub.

1268
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:26,166
(audience laughing)

1269
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:27,875
Interesting.

1270
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:30,625
My turn!

1271
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:34,166
(audience laughing)

1272
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:42,000
I could be merciful and
kill him on the first touch.

1273
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,708
But what fun would that be?

1274
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:49,541
(audience laughing)

1275
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,041
Oh my God.

1276
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:06,458
(audience laughing)

1277
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,250
You know what I mean?

1278
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:16,875
You just had the shit out of me.

1279
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:18,083
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna say.

1280
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:20,333
I love this guy!

1281
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,500
I can't believe it,
it was a winter demigod.

1282
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,000
Oh, I can't believe it.

1283
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:34,625
Back and touch!

1284
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:38,375
Oh, I'm sorry.

1285
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:48,416
Let me make an issue for you.

1286
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,708
(audience laughing)

1287
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:50,250
Come on.

1288
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:54,625
Come.

1289
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:01,375
Come on.

1290
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:05,166
(clicking)

1291
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:06,625
(clicking)

1292
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:19,333
(dramatic music)

1293
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:22,458
Cover us.

1294
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:27,583
(audience laughing)

1295
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:57,041
(dramatic music)

1296
01:27:57,041 --> 01:28:07,375
Come on!

1297
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:18,541
(audience laughing)

1298
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,916
I thought I had some shady friends.

1299
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:31,166
(laughing)

1300
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:33,583
I can't believe that worked.

1301
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,458
Yeah, sorry about that.

1302
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:36,583
It's all I could come up with.

1303
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:37,333
No, it was great.

1304
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:41,750
I misjudged you.

1305
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,875
Now what you'd expect from a
class four naughty lister, right?

1306
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:47,958
What's level four?

1307
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:49,833
But that's what I'm saying.

1308
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:52,541
You could have left, but you didn't.

1309
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:54,708
Thank you.

1310
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,375
All right.

1311
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,291
Should we go find your guy?

1312
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:03,291
Let's save Christmas.

1313
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,250
Right.

1314
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:08,208
Say it.

1315
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,458
I can't.

1316
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:10,416
Yes, you can't say it.

1317
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:11,291
I don't want to.

1318
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:11,958
Let's save Christmas.

1319
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,041
I'm not gonna say that.

1320
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:16,333
I'm gonna need you to
say, let's save Christmas.

1321
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,416
All right, got it.

1322
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:18,791
Okay.

1323
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:20,541
Let's save Christmas.

1324
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:22,541
That was terrible.

1325
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:24,125
Okay.

1326
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:24,750
All right.

1327
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:29,833
Let's save Christmas.

1328
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:31,750
There it is.

1329
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:34,541
All right, so the songbook.

1330
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,791
What's the deal with that?

1331
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:36,458
The glossy pig.

1332
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,416
The glossy pig
gets German for glass cage.

1333
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:40,750
Well, what do you
think we was trying to do?

1334
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,500
Shh.

1335
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,541
Green is trying to be green.

1336
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:47,041
We got a shot.

1337
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:53,125
Mom, ready for another test?

1338
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:55,750
Good.

1339
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:57,500
The next name on the list?

1340
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,250
No.

1341
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:02,375
I have a better idea.

1342
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:07,666
She said she wanted to punish them all.

1343
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:10,000
It seems like the glass
cage was just for one person.

1344
01:30:10,083 --> 01:30:12,041
It's possible she can
make more of them with like,

1345
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,750
witch magic or she
would need millions of them.

1346
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,250
She's immensely powerful,

1347
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,625
but that's a big myth for a contour.

1348
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:20,166
Okay.

1349
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:21,708
I mean, honestly,

1350
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,791
the only place that has
that kind of manufactured passive.

1351
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:24,125
Look out!

1352
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:27,500
(dramatic music)

1353
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:47,833
(piano music)

1354
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,708
Is something that happens to you a lot?

1355
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,541
Unexplained player piano in the middle

1356
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:55,458
of a German highway.

1357
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,583
No, this is rare.

1358
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:06,791
It's for you.

1359
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:08,541
Oh, don't you think?

1360
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:10,791
Just get back in the truck.

1361
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,375
We'll drive right
around the hearts of hand.

1362
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:13,083
I'll be up to over there.

1363
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:17,208
This is how it starts.

1364
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:22,333
You're doing it.

1365
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:26,458
(piano music)

1366
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:31,708
See?

1367
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:38,166
Dylan.

1368
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,250
Can you send me this stupid present

1369
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,375
instead of coming to this thing?

1370
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:43,083
Wait, what?

1371
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:44,916
Because if you don't
wanna come, I don't care.

1372
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:46,833
I wanted to be there.

1373
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:47,500
I really did.

1374
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:47,958
Then something--

1375
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,250
You have to stop, okay?

1376
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:51,000
You're gonna have to pretend

1377
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:52,750
because my mom is guilt-tripping you.

1378
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,125
I'm not pretending.

1379
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:55,333
I really wanna find a way--

1380
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:56,208
You never come to anything.

1381
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:58,875
Yeah, I know, I know.

1382
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,166
Whatever, I gotta go.

1383
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,666
Just don't send me
any more stupid gifts, okay?

1384
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:05,458
Wait, wait, Dylan,
what'd you mean by that?

1385
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:06,375
This thing.

1386
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:09,500
Dylan, don't touch that.

1387
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:10,500
No, don't, wait.

1388
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,250
Do you seriously think that there's any--

1389
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,166
Listen to me, put that down.

1390
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,500
Because I'm here to tell you that.

1391
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:17,250
What is this?

1392
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:18,791
What's going on?

1393
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,000
What's happening?

1394
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:24,916
Put that down.

1395
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,708
Where'd he go?

1396
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:29,916
Where'd he go?

1397
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:30,416
I don't know.

1398
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,625
(eerie music)

1399
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:36,041
Jack?

1400
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:40,750
Where are you?

1401
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:43,958
Find me.

1402
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:52,083
(eerie music)

1403
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,125
Dad?

1404
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:58,791
Dad?

1405
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:00,125
Dylan! What's going on?

1406
01:33:00,916 --> 01:33:01,791
Where are we?

1407
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:05,458
Oh my God.

1408
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,208
Oh my God.

1409
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:13,208
It worked.

1410
01:33:18,708 --> 01:33:22,208
Jack O'Malley, level four.

1411
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:25,375
What a perfect way
to start my collection.

1412
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:28,083
Bring production online.

1413
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:40,041
(eerie music)

1414
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:50,833
Tonight, I will deliver one of these

1415
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:53,791
to every single deviant on the list.

1416
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,916
And when they wake
up and open their gift,

1417
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:58,208
they'll join my collection

1418
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,833
and the world will be
in the hands of the righteous.

1419
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:07,875
Finally, tonight, I make the ride.

1420
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,500
Drip, we have drips.

1421
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:13,750
What happened?

1422
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:15,291
What do you know about the philosophy?

1423
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,041
Mythical magic, snow globe,

1424
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:17,958
you still have drizzled their body.

1425
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:18,833
Prophets has it.

1426
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,166
Why? Not anymore.

1427
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:21,333
The witch has it.

1428
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,041
And I think you're trying
to punish everyone on the list.

1429
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:24,041
Wait, slow down.

1430
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,125
Well, Bally just
got gloated and disappeared.

1431
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,208
What?

1432
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:28,500
His kid too.

1433
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:29,833
Oh dear Lord.

1434
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,458
Ronomelli's tag.

1435
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:32,250
Yes, director.

1436
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,291
Zoe, I think she's trying
to mass produce the philosophy.

1437
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:39,041
How could she possibly do that?

1438
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:40,833
Think about it, what's
the one place that's capable

1439
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:41,791
of something like that?

1440
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:42,458
The North Pole?

1441
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,625
But Nick's not there,
the complex runs on his power,

1442
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:46,541
that can't be it.

1443
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:49,541
Unless-- Unless he never left.

1444
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:52,291
The snow cap, the jet.

1445
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,500
Drones, diversions.

1446
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:57,000
Nick is still there.

1447
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:59,250
Director, I am not picking up the signal

1448
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,250
for O'Malley's tracker.

1449
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,375
Because he's unjust at home.

1450
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:07,083
But I've been
talking to your team all night.

1451
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:08,041
Yeah?

1452
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:13,791
Try Bartridge.

1453
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,250
Connect to Bartridge.

1454
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,208
Yes, director.

1455
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:19,250
Hi, Cal.

1456
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:21,000
Hey, how you holding up, MC?

1457
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:24,750
Oh, I can't sleep, just
keeping myself busy baking cookies

1458
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:27,750
for him, for when he comes home.

1459
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:29,000
Well, he's gonna love that.

1460
01:35:29,583 --> 01:35:30,291
What do you got, bacon?

1461
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,666
Just pulled out a
fresh batch of macaroons.

1462
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:38,375
He'll love that.

1463
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,416
Hang in, and I'll keep you posted.

1464
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:43,333
Thanks.

1465
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:46,458
That's not her.

1466
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:47,750
What do you mean?

1467
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:49,125
Nick hates macaroons.

1468
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:52,375
They're shape shifters.

1469
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:55,375
The witch, the lads,
they're all shape shifters.

1470
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,625
The North Pole has been taken.

1471
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:07,375
They're on to us.

1472
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,041
Where are we?

1473
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:10,750
What's happening?

1474
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,625
Okay, okay, okay, now listen.

1475
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:15,333
Now I know what this is gonna sound like.

1476
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:17,625
Basically,

1477
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:23,416
Santa is missing,

1478
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:26,750
and that giant lady is a witch,

1479
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:30,041
and she got the snow
globes from a giant, demonic,

1480
01:36:30,041 --> 01:36:32,875
Christmas goat man.

1481
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,291
And now they're
gonna make millions of them

1482
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:37,916
with that magical photocopier thing.

1483
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,625
Look, I don't have
all the technical details,

1484
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:42,958
but basically these
globes are meant to imprison

1485
01:36:42,958 --> 01:36:45,291
the naughty people forever.

1486
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:47,083
Forever?

1487
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:47,416
Yeah, I don't know. Forever?

1488
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,125
Not forever, I
didn't scratch that last one.

1489
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:59,458
Remember, I can't trust anyone.

1490
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:03,166
I've got a signal.

1491
01:37:04,333 --> 01:37:05,250
O'Malley is here somewhere.

1492
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:09,416
We're close.

1493
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:10,666
Hey, Chief.

1494
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:12,833
Fred?

1495
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:16,958
I'll let the team know that you're back.

1496
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:18,291
How about you go?

1497
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:24,875
Shape shifters.

1498
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,583
Good tidings.

1499
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34,625
It says he should be right here.

1500
01:37:39,416 --> 01:37:39,750
The old tunnel system.

1501
01:37:39,791 --> 01:37:40,291
The tunnel system.

1502
01:37:41,666 --> 01:37:43,041
Words right
beneath your wristful or jump.

1503
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:44,791
Let's go.

1504
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:48,791
Is this happening because I was ditching?

1505
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:49,416
What?

1506
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:51,250
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1507
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:53,208
No, no, no, no, no, no, Dylan.

1508
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:54,833
You've done this with
naughty people, didn't you?

1509
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:56,583
Well, she said that, but--

1510
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:57,541
What did I do?

1511
01:37:57,625 --> 01:37:59,208
Dylan, look at me.

1512
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:02,958
You may have done some
things that you shouldn't have.

1513
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:05,625
Everybody does, everybody.

1514
01:38:05,916 --> 01:38:07,041
There is nothing wrong with you.

1515
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:12,041
You're only in here because of me.

1516
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:15,708
What did you do?

1517
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:18,375
A lot of stuff.

1518
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,041
Long list.

1519
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:24,708
But bigger than any
of that is what I didn't do.

1520
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:26,791
What are you talking about?

1521
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:34,958
I've been a terrible father.

1522
01:38:37,458 --> 01:38:38,083
It's not true.

1523
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:38,958
Yes, it is.

1524
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:39,916
It is.

1525
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:41,333
I hadn't been around.

1526
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,625
I told myself I was doing
you a favor, which is bullshit.

1527
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:46,041
It was bad for you.

1528
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,041
And it was terrible for me.

1529
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:51,166
I've made some mistakes, pal.

1530
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:51,708
I know that.

1531
01:38:52,791 --> 01:38:54,458
But I also know that I can do better.

1532
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:58,625
And I know that's easier said than done.

1533
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,250
I know it's a lot of
work and I hope it's not too late.

1534
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:03,708
(audience laughing)

1535
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:09,416
Every day, every
decision is an opportunity.

1536
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:14,916
I wanna start taking some of those.

1537
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:18,000
So I'm not asking you to lean me,

1538
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:21,250
just asking for you to give me a chance.

1539
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,791
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

1540
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:27,875
but I know I can do better.

1541
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:30,833
And I'm telling you
right now that I promise

1542
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:33,500
I will never stop trying.

1543
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:40,875
(tense music)

1544
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:57,958
(heavy breathing)

1545
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,541
What just happened?

1546
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,750
I think it's got a little bit nicer.

1547
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,333
Can we get out of here?

1548
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:11,375
Yeah.

1549
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:14,416
First we gotta find somebody, come on.

1550
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:26,083
Oh, yeah.

1551
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,958
If you could make any
toy in the world real right now,

1552
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:30,833
what would it be?

1553
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:34,708
Wonder Woman, Tim.

1554
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:36,250
You all right?

1555
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,833
Yeah, yeah.

1556
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,083
It's good to see you.

1557
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:41,208
Dad?

1558
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:44,583
Buddy, come here.

1559
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:45,958
I want you to meet some friends.

1560
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,125
Cal, Zoe, this is my son, Dylan.

1561
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,500
What have only Dylan and
dad's told me so much about you.

1562
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,708
Welcome to the North Pole.

1563
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,250
I can't believe she got the old

1564
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,625
left applicator back online again.

1565
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:03,291
This thing has been out of
commission since the late 1800s.

1566
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:05,583
This thing was cranking
out snow globes like rat to earth

1567
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:07,416
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1568
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:10,541
Cal, we saw her, she said
she was gonna do the ride herself.

1569
01:41:10,916 --> 01:41:11,166
What?

1570
01:41:11,791 --> 01:41:13,833
Deliver one of these snow
globes to everybody on the list.

1571
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:14,500
That's impossible.

1572
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,125
This lady won't lift off.

1573
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:17,083
Without him.

1574
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,458
Can't let that sleigh take off.

1575
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:23,000
It's so great at an access point, hanger.

1576
01:41:25,125 --> 01:41:25,416
Wait.

1577
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:34,208
Chief.

1578
01:41:35,125 --> 01:41:35,541
I see that.

1579
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:37,125
Cal.

1580
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,291
Ma'am.

1581
01:41:43,208 --> 01:41:43,791
Where is he?

1582
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:47,666
(dramatic music)

1583
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:12,583
(dramatic music)

1584
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:14,416
Greetings, stop!

1585
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:26,833
I was just leaving.

1586
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:29,875
(dramatic music)

1587
01:42:36,708 --> 01:42:39,416
(dramatic music)

1588
01:43:06,666 --> 01:43:09,416
(dramatic music)

1589
01:43:36,708 --> 01:43:45,708
(dramatic music)

1590
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:47,500
(dramatic music)

1591
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:47,666
(dramatic music)

1592
01:43:47,666 --> 01:44:09,416
(dramatic music) (dramatic music)

1593
01:44:36,666 --> 01:44:39,416
(dramatic music)

1594
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:15,625
(dramatic music)

1595
01:45:21,291 --> 01:45:22,625
Nick, I'm not right.

1596
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:24,333
I got you.

1597
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:31,500
(dramatic music)

1598
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:36,583
Red, come back to me.

1599
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:38,458
Come back to me, boss.

1600
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,208
Wake up.

1601
01:45:43,416 --> 01:45:45,750
Nick, Nick, it's Cal.

1602
01:45:49,916 --> 01:45:53,208
(dramatic music)

1603
01:45:59,916 --> 01:46:00,166
Cal!

1604
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:03,375
(dramatic music)

1605
01:46:06,708 --> 01:46:11,875
(dramatic music)

1606
01:46:12,916 --> 01:46:13,458
Holy shit.

1607
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,250
Jack.

1608
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:21,541
Run.

1609
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:24,208
No way, man.

1610
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:27,541
For a guy like me,
there's worse ways to go out

1611
01:46:27,541 --> 01:46:29,083
than by trying to save Santa Claus.

1612
01:46:33,083 --> 01:46:33,250
Rila!

1613
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,875
It's time for you to go.

1614
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:42,625
Oh, I'll go, but I am taking him with me.

1615
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:45,583
You're not taking him anywhere.

1616
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:49,458
His power has been
wasted for far too long.

1617
01:46:49,916 --> 01:46:52,500
The punishing begins tonight.

1618
01:46:54,291 --> 01:46:56,041
You're gonna have to go through me first.

1619
01:46:56,916 --> 01:46:57,750
With pleasure.

1620
01:46:59,666 --> 01:47:00,208
(dramatic music)

1621
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:12,625
(dramatic music)

1622
01:47:19,125 --> 01:47:23,208
You imbeciles have no
idea to talk to a woman like this.

1623
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:25,291
Rila.

1624
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,000
She's my ex.

1625
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,125
Hello, my love.

1626
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:37,000
Get out of here, Grumpus.

1627
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,041
I can't do that.

1628
01:47:40,166 --> 01:47:44,041
And lovely as it is
to see our miserable face,

1629
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:48,791
my Grump is somewhere to be.

1630
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:54,291
(dramatic music)

1631
01:47:58,916 --> 01:48:00,333
Just like all times.

1632
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:03,041
(dramatic music)

1633
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:17,125
(grunting)

1634
01:48:28,833 --> 01:48:34,041
Haven't you had enough?

1635
01:48:36,708 --> 01:48:41,666
You wanna take him,
you're gonna have to kill me.

1636
01:48:42,041 --> 01:48:43,541
Come on, Grumpus.

1637
01:48:45,125 --> 01:48:47,000
Your sacrifice will be nothing.

1638
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:50,708
(grunting)

1639
01:48:51,916 --> 01:48:52,083
Enough!

1640
01:48:54,583 --> 01:48:57,750
These last words for
your most faithful warrior.

1641
01:48:59,166 --> 01:48:59,791
Only one.

1642
01:49:01,875 --> 01:49:02,250
(yelling)

1643
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:08,833
(dramatic music)

1644
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:12,333
Merry Christmas, witch.

1645
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:17,083
(dramatic music)

1646
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:22,958
(grunting)

1647
01:49:22,958 --> 01:49:27,625
(yelling)

1648
01:49:36,125 --> 01:49:39,583
(grunting)

1649
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:44,250
Oh, look at you.

1650
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:46,125
Oh, shut up.

1651
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:50,833
Thank you.

1652
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:53,583
Okay.

1653
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,250
Yeah.

1654
01:49:58,666 --> 01:49:59,958
(dramatic music)

1655
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:02,250
It took you so long.

1656
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:04,500
(laughing)

1657
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:15,833
(dramatic music)

1658
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:23,958
Oh, look what the cat dragged in.

1659
01:50:24,833 --> 01:50:26,958
Let's not get mushy.

1660
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:29,000
Thank you, brother.

1661
01:50:32,958 --> 01:50:33,750
Merry Christmas.

1662
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:36,875
Get out of there.

1663
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:40,875
You wanna maybe stick around a while?

1664
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:46,416
Don't push it.

1665
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:49,250
Get to work.

1666
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:55,208
And you, I want to be much.

1667
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,791
(whistling)

1668
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:01,541
Take this.

1669
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,083
Happy Christmas!

1670
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,458
(yelling)

1671
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,375
Oh my God.

1672
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:14,125
Honey, where are you?

1673
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,791
Mom, you're not gonna believe that.

1674
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:18,333
(dramatic music)

1675
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:21,125
Skytrain, this is Partridge.

1676
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:23,000
Back in the chair and back on track.

1677
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:24,458
Good to have you back, ma'am.

1678
01:51:25,916 --> 01:51:31,041
(dramatic music) (chattering)

1679
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:42,625
(dramatic music)

1680
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:52,208
Dylan.

1681
01:51:53,333 --> 01:51:53,541
Jack.

1682
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,041
Hi.

1683
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,000
Thanks for your help today.

1684
01:51:58,416 --> 01:51:59,125
You have too.

1685
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:01,750
I know.

1686
01:52:06,125 --> 01:52:09,083
All this is a go, 30 seconds to lunch.

1687
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:12,875
Be a dreamt.

1688
01:52:14,041 --> 01:52:15,833
Have a great ride.

1689
01:52:17,916 --> 01:52:18,791
Merry Christmas, director.

1690
01:52:22,291 --> 01:52:23,083
Dylan, Jack.

1691
01:52:24,708 --> 01:52:25,875
You guys coming?

1692
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:28,750
Really?

1693
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:30,041
Come on, let's go.

1694
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:30,750
We gotta roll.

1695
01:52:33,375 --> 01:52:35,416
Red one, you are clear for takeoff.

1696
01:52:38,208 --> 01:52:38,333
(dramatic music)

1697
01:52:53,291 --> 01:52:56,041
(dramatic music)

1698
01:53:23,291 --> 01:53:26,041
(dramatic music)

1699
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:01,791
(dramatic music)

1700
01:54:05,583 --> 01:54:05,958
Copy that.

1701
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:07,458
We're coming at you.

1702
01:54:09,875 --> 01:54:11,416
(dramatic music)

1703
01:54:46,583 --> 01:54:47,000
(dramatic music)

1704
01:54:47,041 --> 01:54:47,750
Jack, Jack.

1705
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:50,791
(dramatic music)

1706
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:57,208
(dramatic music)

1707
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,208
He really does it, doesn't he?

1708
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:02,666
Goes everywhere in
the entire world in one night.

1709
01:55:03,541 --> 01:55:05,250
He's cooler than I thought he was.

1710
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:07,625
And a lot more athletic.

1711
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:09,833
Yeah, guy's a beast.

1712
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:11,000
The guy is a beast.

1713
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:15,541
(dramatic music)

1714
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:19,958
(dramatic music)

1715
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:30,916
(dramatic music)

1716
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:41,250
You're seeing it, aren't you?

1717
01:55:43,083 --> 01:55:44,291
I knew you'd get it back.

1718
01:55:46,458 --> 01:55:47,750
I lost it there for a while, mate.

1719
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:49,500
It's easy to lose it, Cal.

1720
01:55:51,708 --> 01:55:53,041
The important thing is to keep trying.

1721
01:55:55,166 --> 01:55:57,333
(dramatic music)

1722
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:05,041
Nick, I'd like to
stay on, if you'll have me.

1723
01:56:09,083 --> 01:56:10,041
You gotta come, Henry.

1724
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,875
(dramatic music)

1725
01:56:17,541 --> 01:56:17,750
Did we just say it, Christmas?

1726
01:56:17,791 --> 01:56:18,500
Did you say it, Christmas?

1727
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:22,375
I think we just say it, Christmas.

1728
01:56:25,625 --> 01:56:28,291
(dramatic music) Hey, oh, oh

1729
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:30,666
You better watch out

1730
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,583
You better not cry

1731
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:34,541
Better not, not, not

1732
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:35,833
Tell me why

1733
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:38,541
Say it, I'm gonna fuck it

1734
01:56:38,875 --> 01:56:41,125
I'm gonna fuck it

1735
01:56:41,125 --> 01:56:41,875
I'm gonna fuck it

1736
01:56:42,416 --> 01:56:42,958
I'm gonna fuck it

1737
01:56:43,083 --> 01:56:44,750
Say it, I'm gonna fuck it

1738
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,208
I'm gonna make it

1739
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:49,166
I'm gonna fuck it
