1
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,653
Fuck.

2
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:02,437
- Where to?

3
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:06,234
- Traveling, easy to lose stuff.

4
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:07,925
- You don't know where you're
going?

5
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,136
- Patience usually pays off.

6
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,758
Here.

7
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,217
Is there a problem?

8
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,633
- No, no it's, it's just a long
ride.

9
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,531
I was just signing off.

10
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,470
- You're seeing the light.

11
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:37,955
Here.

12
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,959
- Okay, but when we get there
you get out.

13
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,721
You don't fuck around. You get
out.

14
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,480
Hey. Hey, mister.

15
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,276
Your destination. We're here.

16
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,313
Come on!

17
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:00,347
- Right, old man.

18
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,038
Fuck.

19
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,559
Here.

20
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:05,388
Keep the change.

21
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:06,492
- Out.

22
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,632
I'm sure here in Bumfuck
it goes a long way?

23
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,530
- Get out!

24
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,359
Out! Out!

25
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:12,429
- Alright! Fuck!

26
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:14,500
Motherfucker!

27
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,165
Hello?

28
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,009
What the fuck?

29
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,617
Fuck!

30
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,967
- A lovely pring you did.

31
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:19,660
- I don't understand.

32
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:24,665
- So, I guess you're the one.

33
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:25,907
- The one what?

34
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,034
You've got to be shitting me.

35
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:46,609
- I don't understand you.

36
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:18,054
- He says you're like a lamb to
slaughter.

37
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:24,578
My God, let him
in. He is soaking wet!

38
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,649
Please get him a towel.

39
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,314
I know, creepy right?

40
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,938
- Yeah.

41
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:40,972
- You are?

42
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,078
- Luke Matthews.

43
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,256
- Your towel.

44
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,914
Dinner will be served promptly
at eight.

45
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:51,984
Do not be late.

46
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:54,918
- Hey, wait.

47
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,196
Goddammit.

48
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,888
Excuse me.

49
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,199
Fuck,

50
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:01,960
- So you too?

51
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:03,375
- What?

52
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,032
Sorry, yeah.

53
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,654
I received an unmarked envelope

54
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:08,863
and a one way plane ticket and-

55
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:12,177
- an impossible
quantum/bio-quantum equation

56
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,075
that could change life as we
know it?

57
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,387
- Well yes.

58
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,084
And you are?

59
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:24,948
- Ivanna Escalante.

60
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,747
Don't judge a book by
its cover, smart guy.

61
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:33,578
Beneath this exterior beats
the heart of a rationalist.

62
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,651
My graduate dissertation
is on quantum mechanics.

63
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:42,069
- And who was that?

64
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:43,311
The staff?

65
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,174
- I guess.

66
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,210
I don't really know.

67
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:47,695
The rest of us got in
earlier this afternoon.

68
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:49,696
- Hello.

69
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,670
My name is Sophia Sokolova,

70
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:58,292
but please call me Sophie.

71
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
- Luke Matthews.

72
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,746
Russian?

73
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,919
- Yes, you are correct.

74
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:07,853
- It's nice to meet you.

75
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:10,718
So are you an aspiring physicist
as well?

76
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,652
- No, I'm not really aspiring to
anything.

77
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:20,107
I am... well was a medical
student.

78
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,799
Of sorts. Hard to explain.

79
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:25,007
- And?

80
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:28,115
Go on, tell him.

81
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,703
This is fucking cool.

82
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,191
- I suppose what you would
call me is an empath.

83
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:41,369
- Empath, you mean like
a psychic or medium?

84
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,097
- You might say that.

85
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,132
- Gloves?

86
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:49,861
- That's protection.

87
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:56,384
So, what so you
say we show you around,

88
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:59,422
introduce you to Brad and you
can freshen up before dinner?

89
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,148
- That sounds good.

90
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,184
I just need to find a bathroom.

91
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,185
- Of course.

92
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,326
Around the corner, on the left.

93
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:08,361
- Got it.

94
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:18,717
- Another scientist? He seems
nice.

95
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:19,752
- I hope so.

96
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,099
- What do you mean?

97
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:27,761
- I don't know; something seems
weird.

98
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,489
Sorry, Ivanna... never mind.

99
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,284
- One of your premonitions?

100
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:41,015
- I sense... desperation.

101
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,225
Someone running away from
something.

102
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,886
Someone with something to hide.

103
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:53,269
- And you're getting that from
the ether?

104
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:24,196
This is something else

105
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:26,095
- We haven't had much time to
explore,

106
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:28,028
but yes, I'd say "something
else"

107
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,168
is an adequate description.

108
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,928
- Is "it" here?

109
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:33,067
Have you seen it?

110
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,103
- It's safe.

111
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:34,966
You sure?

112
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,277
- Yes, come and meet Luke.

113
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,595
- I never should have come.

114
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,838
- Brad, this is Luke.

115
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,600
- Luke Matthews. It's nice to
meet you

116
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,533
- That motherfucker is not
right.

117
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,501
I am telling you that
he isn't right and...

118
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,476
- Yeah, well, an associate
professor

119
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,514
of physics and quantum mechanics
at Miskatonic University.

120
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:10,967
Yes. Myself, the
pharmaceutical sciences.

121
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,212
So what did you make of that
invitation?

122
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,629
- I'm not sure really.

123
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:21,012
It's fascinating, it's
curiosity-inspiring.

124
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,566
But of course it's improbable.

125
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,431
- I must say I disagree.

126
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:28,398
- Really? 'cause you always
disa-

127
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:31,918
- What was that?

128
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:44,104
Are you okay?

129
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,553
What is it?

130
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:49,419
- I don't know, I felt a
surge of psionic energy

131
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,180
just as I heard the crash.

132
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:54,045
I still feel it.

133
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,012
- Do you expect me to
believe in the impossible?

134
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,393
- Believe what you want,

135
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:59,395
but didn't you just fly
halfway around the world

136
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,191
to investigate something you
claim to be "impossible"?

137
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,642
- What is this?

138
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,956
- This? It was not us.

139
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:09,991
- I am not so sure.

140
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,891
- We can clean it if you want.

141
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,514
- NO! Dinner will be served
shortly

142
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,518
and your honored host does
not tolerate tardiness.

143
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,418
Understand?

144
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:27,009
- Great effort, many were
expended to greet you

145
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:30,115
all here for this momentous
occasion.

146
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,153
Now, if you please.

147
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:39,123
Chop, chop!

148
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,263
- Chop, chop.

149
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,684
- This is me.

150
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,067
I just need a moment.

151
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,448
- And I am across the hall here.

152
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,278
I will meet you guys downstairs.

153
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:34,455
- I do prefer a little privacy

154
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,250
so I took a room on the other
end.

155
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:38,632
There's plenty to choose from.

156
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:42,739
Do you smoke?

157
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,672
- Cigarettes? No thanks.

158
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:46,743
- Not cigarettes. Cannabis?

159
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:49,643
- I don't mean just to get high.

160
00:15:49,677 --> 00:15:51,196
I mean I use it as a tool

161
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,751
to help unfocus my social
anxiety.

162
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:57,996
- You know it's funny,

163
00:15:58,031 --> 00:15:59,077
sometimes the herb mellows out
you fear

164
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,447
and then other times -

165
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,138
- she kicks your ass.

166
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:04,382
- Yeah, I could use some of
that.

167
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:23,332
- This is a special
cush, really nice dreams.

168
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,093
- Muchos Gracias Senor.

169
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,149
- Ass kicked already.

170
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:53,706
- Cool.

171
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,676
Wow, strong shit.

172
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:13,864
- Weird.

173
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,149
The fuck was I doing?

174
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:48,554
Fuck me.

175
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,748
Hey, Sophie. You
ready?

176
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:45,622
Of course, you dumb bitch.

177
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,432
- Please be seated.

178
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:30,760
- I say we eac-

179
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,795
- SILENCE!

180
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:36,697
Ladies, gentlemen, distinguished
guests.

181
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:39,976
I present Dr. Richard Cernovich.

182
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,431
- Call me Cerno.

183
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:50,504
Klaatu, attend me.

184
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:56,302
- Ice cold.

185
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:15,253
- Heaven Klaatu.

186
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:20,810
Well, I hope you have all
found the accommodations

187
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,845
to your liking?

188
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,022
- Cernovich? ...Cernovich?

189
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,024
- I know that name.

190
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:31,304
The devil you do.

191
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:35,860
- A colleague of mine, turned
me on to some research papers

192
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:39,726
written by a Professor Richard
Cernovich.

193
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:44,386
The man was a genius.

194
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:50,392
A pioneer in neuropsychiatry,
theoretical physics

195
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:53,843
and an innovator in the
field of quantum biology.

196
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,294
- That same Cernovich was
banished from academia

197
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,813
and exiled from the United
States

198
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:01,299
for unethical human
experimentation in 1973.

199
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:04,302
All records from his
mind-mapping sub-project

200
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,960
were destroyed and it's
very existence classified

201
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:08,686
Top Secret.

202
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,033
- The Cernovich Horrors?

203
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,794
- So you're the Manchurian
Candidate guy.

204
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,418
- Long time ago.

205
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,490
- A lot of dead people because
of you.

206
00:21:19,524 --> 00:21:22,734
- Murder, mutilation, genocides,
slavery,

207
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,392
all have been perpetuated
under frameworks that said they

208
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:27,705
were lawful and legal,

209
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:29,983
as long as you abided by the
regulations.

210
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:34,988
- Trauma based mind control,
MK Ultra, Project Parrot,

211
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:36,300
Project Doll.

212
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:41,339
Experimenting on human
populations, LSD,

213
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,517
behavioral control of entire
cultures.

214
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:49,968
- That wasn't my program
but I did take it over, yes.

215
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,698
My son heads it up now,
or what's left of it.

216
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,907
All above board and legal.

217
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,566
As you said yourself, Mr.
Matthews,

218
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:04,051
I was an innovator, a scientist.

219
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:07,365
A respected member of
the academic community

220
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,885
until a moment of political
cowardice.

221
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:15,028
Literally overnight I became
a disgrace, a criminal,

222
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:20,067
but not without a code of
conduct.

223
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:24,761
Klaatu,

224
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:26,728
siticulosus.

225
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:46,853
Thank you Klaatu.

226
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,029
Well enough about me.

227
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:54,619
Let's go around the horn shall
we,

228
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:55,965
and really get acquainted.

229
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:02,524
Brad Richards, born in Zaria,
Nigeria.

230
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,044
A pharmaceutical scientist,
mathematician and chemist

231
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,185
hailing from Kings College
London.

232
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,946
His main research interests are
in

233
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,018
the areas of breathable gases,
anesthesia.

234
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:19,161
As well as the development of
designer recreational drugs

235
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:22,544
with particular emphasis on
ecstasy.

236
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:26,513
- No.

237
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:27,766
The local tabloids dubbed him

238
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,861
"The Pied Piper of Manchester."

239
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:34,487
His designer pills would
lure thousands of teenagers

240
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:35,936
to massive rave parties,

241
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:38,801
until one fateful night last
September.

242
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,598
When some 250 teenagers died.

243
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:50,192
Thanks to a young hot shot city
barrister

244
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:52,953
Brad was acquitted on a
technicality.

245
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:56,578
Narrowly escaping an angry
mob of grieving parents,

246
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:59,753
Brad slipped out of the
country in the dead of night,

247
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,239
not to be seen again, until now.

248
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:05,862
- Not true.

249
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,934
But it is.

250
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,075
Feeling a little anxious are we?

251
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,874
- It, first of all, it wasn't my
fault.

252
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:18,738
- Relax, Mr. Richards.

253
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,878
No need to explain.

254
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:22,673
You're among friends here.

255
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,089
We understand your social
phobias.

256
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:27,056
- So do you have a file on each
of us?

257
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,817
- The man always has a file.

258
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:36,134
- A first-generation US
citizen of Argentinian descent,

259
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:40,173
and the first in her
family to attend college.

260
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:42,624
Ivanna earned her Bachelor's
of Science in Physics

261
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:46,869
from the University of
California San Diego in 2015,

262
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:51,046
graduating at the top of her
class.

263
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,357
She was awarded the

264
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:56,914
Physical Sciences Dean's
Undergraduate Award for
Excellence.

265
00:24:56,948 --> 00:25:00,780
In addition the Dean also
awarded her

266
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:02,747
with a scandalous affair.

267
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,752
- We would have broken all the
barriers.

268
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:08,787
You and me.

269
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:13,827
- Yes, you're very fond
of loyalty, aren't you.

270
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:18,038
You have nothing to fear from
me.

271
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,766
I am loyal to those who deserve
it.

272
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,014
Sophie Sokolov.

273
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:32,052
You have been obsessed with NDE
phenomena

274
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,296
ever since the tragic
loss of your twin sister

275
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,884
at the tender age of eleven.

276
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:40,578
However it was this
tragedy that awakened your

277
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:42,269
special "gift".

278
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:45,583
Sophie was recently
dismissed from her residency

279
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:49,000
at Novosibirsk State Medical
University.

280
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:52,072
Seems she fell in with a small
group

281
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:55,800
of students conducting
clandestine experiments

282
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:59,252
to produce near-death
experiences.

283
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:05,638
Unable to prove which one
of the suspects administered

284
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:08,295
the drug that stopped the
victim's heart,

285
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:12,817
the case was thrown out
and the charges dismissed.

286
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,027
- Kapstein knew the risk.

287
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:19,755
- If I'm not mistaken
poor Mr. Kapstein ran

288
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,413
into problems in Syracuse.

289
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,106
Apparently, he was worse
than you with volunteers.

290
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:33,355
You killed Hank Jones, who
gave the injection to Kapstein.

291
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:36,289
You are nothing if not
prodigious.

292
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:40,880
Jabbed that sucker right into
his neck.

293
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:45,816
Fired dose after dose into
him, popped the carotid artery.

294
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,405
And they say the blood is still

295
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,270
in the cracks of the floor
and under the cabinets.

296
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:54,893
Impressive.

297
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,415
- You're enjoying this.

298
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,799
- I have to hand it to you,
Sophie, you got away with it.

299
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:08,045
Simply disappeared to
the UK as a new resident,

300
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,084
outside the purview of our
mutual friend, Inspector Tanaka.

301
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:17,399
- You're a blackmailer in the
spirit.

302
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:20,436
- Nothing so harsh, Sophie. An
offer.

303
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,235
- You don't need to say it.

304
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:29,755
I did it!

305
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,177
I killed my fiancé.

306
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:41,181
I didn't mean to.

307
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,151
But you did.

308
00:27:57,335 --> 00:27:58,335
- Yes.

309
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,826
- No worries Luke, Honorem
latrones.

310
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,380
- Latin. "There is honor among
thieves."

311
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:11,211
- I think what he means to say
is

312
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,835
that he thinks he can trust us.

313
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:14,905
- With what?

314
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,011
Why the security?

315
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,046
Paranoia?

316
00:28:22,188 --> 00:28:25,260
- Each one of you have been
searching for the same thing,

317
00:28:26,192 --> 00:28:29,057
albeit for different reasons.

318
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:32,819
A way to breach the Quantum
Barrier.

319
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:37,962
- The key to the manipulation
of time is control of space.

320
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:42,242
Perhaps, the answer to the
mystery of the afterlife

321
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,347
is in death.

322
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:48,421
What happens when we die?

323
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:51,735
Is it like Buddha said,
a candle blowing out.

324
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:54,910
One cannot say where the flame
went.

325
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,743
- What do you think is out
there?

326
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:05,887
- Creation itself.

327
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,235
Obviously, it doesn't come from

328
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:11,202
what has already been created,

329
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:12,479
from the world we live in.

330
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:15,379
So it must be there.

331
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:20,177
Coming from what is darkness to
us now.

332
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:26,908
Sophie, you see beings
from there as they enter

333
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:29,842
into our space, yes.

334
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:30,876
- Yes.

335
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:35,433
- Now just imagine going there,

336
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:37,435
in the same way.

337
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:41,577
Except with all aspects
of control and purpose.

338
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:46,790
Not for a flash of an instant
with DMT or LSD or meditation,

339
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:52,347
but as a sentient being.

340
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,869
Capable of everything.

341
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:07,500
Let's get down to business shall
we?

342
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:08,950
Klaatu.

343
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,889
- Mein ibento o hikidasu.

344
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:25,069
- My friends, I give you the
greatest quantum breakthrough

345
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,864
of the last 200 years,

346
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:32,524
Quantamine.

347
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:35,321
- There is a risk.

348
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,357
- This is not from a human
source.

349
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:40,982
- So if I may ask,
Professor, where is it from?

350
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:42,086
- Fuck.

351
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:44,640
- It's very existence
defies the laws of nature.

352
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:47,367
- It comes from them. And
you don't fuck with them.

353
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:48,990
- As it should be with a
substance

354
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:52,027
that can rearrange every
molecule in and around your body

355
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:54,271
instantaneously upon contact.

356
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:56,583
- I believe that within each one
of you

357
00:30:57,584 --> 00:31:00,898
lies a piece of the key to
breaching the quantum barrier.

358
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,453
We have known this was
possible on a quantum level

359
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,488
for some time now.

360
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,493
Theorem with protons,
magnetic fields, lasers,

361
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,081
sonic resonance.

362
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:16,327
What was missing was the
bio-mechanical component,

363
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:19,399
the quantamine and...

364
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:20,159
- The soul.

365
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:23,162
- The psychic component.
Control.

366
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,680
- The nexus, perhaps.

367
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:27,097
- Dangerous.

368
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:28,131
- Illegal.

369
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,586
- Now, I have a crude but
sufficient lab

370
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,415
set up here in the house.

371
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:38,522
Would any of you care to join
me?

372
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:46,185
- This way please.

373
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:47,324
Mind your step!

374
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,156
The Quantum Chamber!

375
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:55,470
- What the...

376
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:59,612
- Yeah man! We all owe you a
thanks, in advance, friends.

377
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:02,995
Slow down. The dead?

378
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,513
- You worried, young man?

379
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,412
- Don't be troubled, Luke.

380
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:08,310
Your soul is beautiful.

381
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,311
- What about mine?

382
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:10,174
- I don't think...

383
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,209
- Quiet now!

384
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:24,464
- I see, you are using tuning
forks

385
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,259
to generate a frequency

386
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,294
- Very good.

387
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:31,264
- To synchronize the proton
waves within this chamber.

388
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,370
- How did you determine
the correct frequency?

389
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:36,442
- I haven't, yet. But
now that you are here.

390
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:39,652
- Did you actually achieve
a stable atomization

391
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:41,481
of the quantamine into vapor?

392
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,000
- We did indeed.

393
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,451
However the liquid form
of the quantamine seems

394
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,523
to dissolve the skin tissue upon
contact.

395
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:52,009
- Sophie, what is it?

396
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:57,739
- I sense darkness, a presence.

397
00:32:58,636 --> 00:33:00,673
- Perhaps you are sensing
the recent loss of life

398
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:02,295
in this very room.

399
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,262
- Loss of life?

400
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:06,127
- Yes, Dr. Wallace
Keith, a dear old friend

401
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:09,164
and long time colleague
was rather careless during

402
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:12,478
our last attempt to breach
the barrier... and it cost us.

403
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:13,651
- It cost him.

404
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,517
- For me, the use of my legs.

405
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,452
For Wallace, his life.

406
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:22,487
- A word

407
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:31,542
- I am afraid I have an urgent
matter

408
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,740
requiring my immediate
attention.

409
00:33:33,775 --> 00:33:36,467
I must leave for Geneva at once.

410
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:38,400
I shall not be more than a day
or two.

411
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,232
- What about us?

412
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,819
What do you want us to do then?

413
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,721
- Please, by all means proceed,
my dear.

414
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,596
Everything that happens in this
lab

415
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,382
is automatically documented and
recorded

416
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,212
on a secure server here in the
house.

417
00:33:57,247 --> 00:34:00,250
I expect you lot can pick
up where we left off.

418
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:05,289
- What's in it for us Cerno?

419
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:07,533
- What is it that you want Mr.
Matthews?

420
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:10,156
Credit, Fame?

421
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:12,779
How about a a Nobel prize?

422
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:15,472
I know without a doubt,

423
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:17,474
each one of you would
complete this experiment.

424
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:22,134
If for no other reason then
to satisfy your own curiosity.

425
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,106
$500,000 each.

426
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:31,798
Enough to start over.

427
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,112
A fresh start, a new name.

428
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:38,357
Freedom from the past.

429
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,807
What say you?

430
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:41,808
- Done.

431
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,086
- Yes, I agree.

432
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:47,331
- Yes, yes of course.

433
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:48,366
- Excellent.

434
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:51,818
Fortune favors the bold my
friends.

435
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,201
Alea jacta est.

436
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,358
- All right, how do we ingest
a drug that we can't touch

437
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,222
because it literally eats flesh?

438
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:53,846
- I don't believe it is eating
the flesh.

439
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,469
I believe the quantamine is
instantaneously breaching

440
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:59,610
the barrier between this
dimension and the next.

441
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:01,761
- You mean that the parts of
the body in direct contact

442
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,477
with the liquid are still there,
here?

443
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:07,860
You know what I mean,
but in another dimension?

444
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,001
- Basic, but yeah.

445
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,659
- Yes, basic, like you.

446
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:14,522
- You wish.

447
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:17,352
- Hey, can we not. Please?

448
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:23,324
- Okay. No one could survive
that state of dual separation.

449
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:32,436
What we have to do is balance
the quantum entanglement.

450
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:34,300
- Please, go on.

451
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:40,272
- Perhaps simultaneously
immersing the body in some type

452
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:42,584
of quantamine based saline
solution

453
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:43,699
at the same time of injection?

454
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,794
- No, we do not have
enough quantamine for that,

455
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,840
nor any type of float tank big
enough

456
00:36:46,864 --> 00:36:48,590
to accommodate even one of us.

457
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,421
But, according to these notes,

458
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:56,288
Cerno and his colleague
they were almost there.

459
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:58,531
Here. Look at this.

460
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:01,638
I see.

461
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:05,780
So, what if when I change
the state of the quantamine

462
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:08,817
from it's liquid form,
to the atmospheric gas.

463
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,682
We also generate a more
refined breathable gas?

464
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:14,892
Which I can dilute with a
solution to allow the body

465
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:17,550
enough time to achieve
superposition.

466
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:18,585
- Yes!

467
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:21,520
A critical balance between the
internal

468
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,901
and external exposure to the
quantamine,

469
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:26,766
all at a controlled rate.

470
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:30,080
- OK, all right. With your help
I can rig these tuning forks

471
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,082
to generate a frequency,

472
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:36,086
a constant 432 Hz which
should synchronize the proton

473
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,615
within the chamber with the
atomization of

474
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,434
the quantamine gas.

475
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:41,643
- I'm your girl.

476
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,783
- And, according to Cerno's
notes,

477
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:48,823
this 'thing' will amplify my
psionic abilities and link us,

478
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,376
our consciousness.

479
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,069
This will allow me to
act as a 'mental anchor.'

480
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:02,457
- Guys, I think this is going to
work.

481
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:31,417
- Klaatu! Klaatu!

482
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,632
I expect everything is
proceeding according to my plan?

483
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:41,910
- Flawlessly, Sir.

484
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,432
- Good. Let us begin, shall we?

485
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:43,869
- Are you ready sir?

486
00:39:45,457 --> 00:39:46,803
- Age quod agis!

487
00:41:01,774 --> 00:41:03,258
- Come, come, come.

488
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:06,744
Slow, slow.

489
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:15,261
- All right. Anyone want out?

490
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,262
Last chance.

491
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:20,369
No?

492
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:24,685
All right sound off as I count
us down.

493
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,550
- 1st position, go.

494
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,798
- 2nd position, go.

495
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:40,977
3, 2... One.

496
00:42:47,052 --> 00:42:48,640
- Command position in 3, 2, 1.

497
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:53,445
- What happened?

498
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,034
- I'm a little hazy me-self.

499
00:45:56,931 --> 00:45:59,416
- I just woke up on the bathroom
floor?

500
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:02,315
I don't remember...

501
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:06,561
- What the hell happened?

502
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:07,839
- Shouldn't you know?

503
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,497
- What did you assholes do to
me?

504
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:12,533
- I could say the same.

505
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:16,019
- Hey, hey, we're all a
little concerned about

506
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:18,815
how exactly things what
went down last night.

507
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,092
We all need to calm down.

508
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,311
- What? Did you all lure me
into a trap or what something?

509
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:24,303
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can
sod off with that rubbish!

510
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:26,133
- Who lured you into a trap?

511
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:27,928
What the fuck are you talking
about?

512
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:29,067
- I could ask you the same.

513
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:30,447
- Why can't I shine?

514
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:33,865
It's a blank since the lab.

515
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:36,108
When has that ever happened?

516
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:38,490
- Something is heavy.

517
00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:42,839
A block, some sort of physic
barrier.

518
00:46:44,151 --> 00:46:45,151
- The Lab!

519
00:46:46,532 --> 00:46:47,532
The cameras!

520
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,400
- FUCK!!!

521
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,401
The Quantamine is gone.

522
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,264
The fuck?

523
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:55,127
What is it?

524
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:55,990
- Check the computer.

525
00:46:56,025 --> 00:46:57,025
Do we have video?

526
00:46:57,923 --> 00:46:58,923
Anything?

527
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,580
Move.

528
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:04,653
What'd you do?

529
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:07,450
- Did you try the back up?

530
00:47:07,484 --> 00:47:08,554
- That is the back-up.

531
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,287
The gas system is fucked.

532
00:47:17,322 --> 00:47:18,599
- What about the scanner?

533
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:21,119
The paper readouts?

534
00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:26,607
It's, it's gone,

535
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:29,299
everything from the breach point
is gone.

536
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:30,576
Sophie, you're our meta link.

537
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:32,544
- I have nothing but a splitting
headache?

538
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:34,408
- Of course 'cause fucking
useless.

539
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:36,065
Yob tvoyu mat!

540
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:37,618
- Hey! Hey, hey... come on guys.

541
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:39,137
That is not going to help us.

542
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:40,448
- I'm sorry, I just...

543
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,314
- I don't know about the rest
of you but I am so thirsty.

544
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:45,349
We need a break.

545
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:49,285
Let's get some coffee, catch our
breath,

546
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:50,538
then we will sort this all out?

547
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:53,668
- Yeah, I need some smoke.

548
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:04,402
- Sorry.

549
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:20,247
- You can't really live
with what happened,

550
00:48:20,281 --> 00:48:23,388
because you feel so deeply,

551
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:25,424
so much guilt.

552
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:29,083
It's delicious. Watching you
struggle.

553
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:30,533
- What the fuck.

554
00:48:31,465 --> 00:48:33,570
- How can you live with
yourself?

555
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:36,297
With what you did?

556
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:37,747
- What the fuck is this?

557
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,576
- What the fuck is this?

558
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:47,446
- GUYS!
- G uys come back here and...

559
00:49:14,715 --> 00:49:17,373
Ouch!

560
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:19,375
What the fucking fuck stop!

561
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:25,622
Now listen here you fucking stop

562
00:49:25,657 --> 00:49:29,212
and I mean right fucking now you

563
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:32,043
Zacroy svoy peesavati rot,
sooka.

564
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,201
- It's okay, can you hear me?

565
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:53,236
- Here let me help.

566
00:49:56,377 --> 00:49:57,482
All right I got a pulse.

567
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:59,518
Let's get her downstairs.

568
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:01,624
- Got her? Got her?

569
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,421
Here take her, take her, watch
her head, watch her head.

570
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:08,527
- No

571
00:50:08,562 --> 00:50:09,390
- Let me help you.

572
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:10,253
- Don't.

573
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:11,116
- I'm trying to help you.

574
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:11,772
- Don't, don't touch me.

575
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:12,635
- Okay, fuck.

576
00:50:12,669 --> 00:50:13,498
Take a hit.

577
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:14,533
- NOOO!

578
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:19,780
I'm so sorry.

579
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:21,816
I just have to work through
this.

580
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:24,129
I have not felt this
out of control since...

581
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:25,130
Since my sister...

582
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:26,580
- Let me help you to your room,

583
00:50:26,614 --> 00:50:28,651
maybe if you just lay down a
bit,

584
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:31,136
have some quiet time to
yourself.

585
00:50:31,171 --> 00:50:35,761
- Yeah, but please do not touch
me.

586
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:37,280
I can sense you all now.

587
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:39,282
Even without a physical
connection.

588
00:50:39,317 --> 00:50:42,389
When you touch me, it's too
much.

589
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:43,286
- Will these work?

590
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:44,321
- Yes, thank you.

591
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:50,397
And guys, I will be as
succinct as possible.

592
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,606
You ALL...

593
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,747
You need to go rub one out,
masturbate.

594
00:50:55,781 --> 00:50:57,093
Play with yourself.

595
00:50:57,128 --> 00:50:58,408
Do whatever it is you need to do

596
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:00,683
to ease some of this sexual
tension.

597
00:51:00,717 --> 00:51:03,444
Yes, a side effect of the
quantamine.

598
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:06,792
- Some of you have some
really kinky fetishes.

599
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:10,727
Definitely more than I
want to know about you.

600
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:12,212
Ever.

601
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:14,248
- Come on hon, let's get you
upstairs.

602
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:16,354
- Yeah, thanks.

603
00:51:16,388 --> 00:51:17,424
- Rub one out? Right.

604
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:20,427
- Maybe I'll take you up on your
offer.

605
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:21,324
- What?

606
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,359
- The smoke?

607
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:24,361
Yeah.

608
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,571
You are more than welcome Luke.

609
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:44,898
- I can feel...

610
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:50,767
- No

611
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:52,390
- I can't help it.

612
00:51:56,566 --> 00:51:58,534
- I don't think we are safe.

613
00:51:58,568 --> 00:51:59,569
- From Brad?

614
00:52:01,192 --> 00:52:02,193
Luke?

615
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:03,849
- No, something else.

616
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:15,654
I'm going to take a shower.

617
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,366
- You are serious.

618
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:48,470
- Always.

619
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:54,615
When I was 11 years old I
scored 162 on the Mensa test.

620
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:56,962
Earning the label of child
genius

621
00:53:56,997 --> 00:53:59,517
and considered to be the
smartest boy in London.

622
00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:02,761
The social anxiety alone was
crippling.

623
00:54:05,005 --> 00:54:06,938
- Gets you picked on a lot.

624
00:54:06,972 --> 00:54:07,972
- Exactly.

625
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:11,666
This!

626
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:15,498
Sativa-dominant hybrid,

627
00:54:20,434 --> 00:54:21,470
White Fire!

628
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:28,546
- Wow.

629
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,548
- Initially you will
find it a very uplifting

630
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:32,066
and euphoric feeling.

631
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:34,759
Then it induces a calming,

632
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,727
somewhat sedentary effect
as you start to come down.

633
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,731
This is probably due to its
significant concentrations

634
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:45,425
of Beta-Caryophyllene,
Limonene, and Alpha Humulene.

635
00:54:46,874 --> 00:54:51,603
It averages at about 22-25% THC;

636
00:54:51,638 --> 00:54:54,675
and it's also known to
have CBD as high as 5%.

637
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,679
In either case, it should
put you right to sleep,

638
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,545
right after you "rub one out".

639
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,722
- On second thought, I
am going to take a pass.

640
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:08,793
- Suit yourself, mate.

641
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:11,554
- I appreciate the offer though.

642
00:55:16,628 --> 00:55:17,664
- Anytime, Luke.

643
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:31,919
Hey lover.

644
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:36,061
- Hello?

645
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:47,796
Hello?

646
00:56:22,487 --> 00:56:23,592
- Ouch! Shit!

647
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:27,527
Bitch.

648
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:38,122
- Biscuit.

649
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:41,505
Bangers.

650
00:56:43,957 --> 00:56:44,957
Mash.

651
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:55,623
Munchies.

652
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:39,752
- Ivanna?

653
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:47,036
Hey, um, I didn't mean
to come off as bitch.

654
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,348
You know?

655
00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:50,005
I'm sorry too.

656
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:53,042
I didn't believe you at first.

657
00:59:53,077 --> 00:59:54,699
- Ivanna?

658
01:00:13,304 --> 01:00:15,893
- What the hell are you doing?

659
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:33,219
Hello?

660
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:08,358
Okay.

661
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:10,774
Haha.

662
01:01:12,156 --> 01:01:13,675
What do you want?

663
01:01:14,848 --> 01:01:16,919
You still mad at me?

664
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:56,959
- Hello Sister,

665
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:01,308
it has been too long!

666
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:33,409
My dear Sophie,

667
01:02:33,444 --> 01:02:38,449
now you can finally have the
answers you have searched for

668
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:41,107
all of your pathetic life!

669
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:47,838
So you want to know happened
after what you did to me?

670
01:02:47,872 --> 01:02:49,425
When you murdered me?

671
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:55,052
Here, sister, see for yourself,
tell me.

672
01:02:55,086 --> 01:02:57,192
What do you see?

673
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:04,889
Welcome to the eternal night!

674
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,044
Goodbye sister.

675
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:00,980
- No please!

676
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:02,014
Let me go!

677
01:04:03,396 --> 01:04:05,053
Let me... come back!

678
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:38,309
God No!

679
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:40,173
Spit the out.

680
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,209
It's poison.

681
01:06:43,556 --> 01:06:45,144
No! Spit them out!

682
01:06:46,248 --> 01:06:47,318
I made them.

683
01:06:47,353 --> 01:06:48,353
No!

684
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:50,632
Please listen to me.

685
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,047
Spit them out.

686
01:07:39,715 --> 01:07:41,441
- Please forgive me!

687
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:52,728
- God, please forgive me!

688
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,695
Ahhhhhh.

689
01:09:10,254 --> 01:09:11,254
Fuck!

690
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,014
God!

691
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:15,880
Fuck!

692
01:09:15,915 --> 01:09:16,915
Jesus!

693
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,300
Shit!

694
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,617
- You cocksucker!

695
01:09:28,652 --> 01:09:30,999
I was just about to cum for a
change.

696
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:35,245
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

697
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:35,900
You're dead.

698
01:09:35,935 --> 01:09:37,385
I know you're dead!

699
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:38,419
- I'm alive.

700
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:41,596
Here I'm very much alive.

701
01:09:46,635 --> 01:09:50,639
In this "Quantum Hell" you have
unleashed,

702
01:09:50,674 --> 01:09:53,194
I'm every bit as real
as you are sweetheart.

703
01:09:55,368 --> 01:09:56,714
- The experiment. It failed?

704
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:58,716
God.

705
01:09:58,751 --> 01:10:00,339
- Why would you think that?

706
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,690
- Crazy bitch.

707
01:10:08,485 --> 01:10:09,865
Brad! Brad! Wake up man.

708
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,833
Wake the fuck up.

709
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:13,593
Brad! Fuck!

710
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:21,705
- What the fuck are you yelling
about?

711
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:26,744
- Fuck.

712
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:33,372
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

713
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:20,384
- What the hell?

714
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:24,870
- Could be.

715
01:11:26,459 --> 01:11:27,529
Or any one of

716
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:31,809
an infinite number

717
01:11:33,673 --> 01:11:34,881
of dimensions.

718
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:41,819
- Sophie, about earlier, I'm
sorry I was so aggressive.

719
01:11:44,408 --> 01:11:45,408
- Do you like me?

720
01:11:47,963 --> 01:11:50,690
- Yes. I do like you, Sophie.

721
01:11:58,802 --> 01:11:59,802
- Do you love me?

722
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:02,943
- I think so.

723
01:12:04,394 --> 01:12:06,430
- Do you want to finish what you
started?

724
01:12:11,918 --> 01:12:14,127
- Look out the window.

725
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,784
The experiment... it must have
worked.

726
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:18,960
- Of course it did, with the
help of Cerno and my sister.

727
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:21,721
- Cerno?

728
01:12:21,756 --> 01:12:22,756
Sister?

729
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:26,347
- Stupid little Sophie.

730
01:12:27,762 --> 01:12:31,041
Cerno used her and fooled you
all.

731
01:12:34,631 --> 01:12:35,631
- Sophie?

732
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,531
What is wrong with you?

733
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:40,015
What are you talking about?

734
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,050
- For starters,

735
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:45,711
my name is not Sophie.

736
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:48,541
Soooopheeeee.

737
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:53,027
How pedestrian.

738
01:12:54,651 --> 01:12:59,380
My name is Katia and now for the
finale.

739
01:13:00,864 --> 01:13:03,038
I will be ending your pathetic
life.

740
01:13:03,073 --> 01:13:04,626
It's faster if you go with it,
girl.

741
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:07,698
- Fuck you bitch!

742
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:09,424
- Whooo

743
01:13:09,459 --> 01:13:10,701
You go girl!

744
01:13:10,736 --> 01:13:12,531
Give it to me baby.

745
01:13:12,565 --> 01:13:14,222
Give it to me baby, come on.

746
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,706
Come one girl.

747
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:16,811
Whooooohoooo.

748
01:13:19,745 --> 01:13:23,093
- How stupid of me to think this
is Hell.

749
01:13:25,509 --> 01:13:26,579
- Hell?

750
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:27,614
- Fuck.

751
01:13:28,961 --> 01:13:32,585
- I never believed in hell, or
heaven.

752
01:13:35,692 --> 01:13:37,728
I may need to reevaluate my
beliefs.

753
01:13:38,695 --> 01:13:40,144
- My God!

754
01:13:40,179 --> 01:13:42,595
- Look man, can we move
past this skin thing?

755
01:13:44,632 --> 01:13:45,632
- Does it hurt?

756
01:13:46,737 --> 01:13:47,876
- Like a Mother Fucker!

757
01:13:49,671 --> 01:13:51,086
Unless I am smoking this Kush.

758
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:54,193
It really seems to take the edge
off?

759
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:56,851
But is it really Kush?

760
01:13:58,197 --> 01:13:59,647
Is any of this really real?

761
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:02,821
Are you?

762
01:14:03,685 --> 01:14:06,619
Maybe I shouldn't think
about it that hard,

763
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:07,896
you know what I mean?

764
01:14:07,931 --> 01:14:08,931
Here man.

765
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:11,486
- No thanks.

766
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:24,119
Look man, the experiment!

767
01:14:24,154 --> 01:14:25,155
It worked.

768
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:26,708
Do you realize where we are?

769
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:29,504
- We've all been duped, Luke.

770
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:32,196
- We need to get down to the
lab.

771
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,164
- Already been down there.

772
01:14:34,198 --> 01:14:38,202
Well, down there in regards
to this dimension down there,

773
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:41,827
back on the flip side they
are hauling off bodies.

774
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:43,276
- What?

775
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:45,002
- Well, I guess I should get
down to it.

776
01:14:45,037 --> 01:14:46,037
- To what?

777
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:48,039
- Killing you,

778
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:51,699
the you here.

779
01:14:51,733 --> 01:14:53,528
You, you?

780
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:55,564
You get it?

781
01:14:57,774 --> 01:15:01,018
You're not very comfortable
with yourself are you?

782
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:02,710
Things are better when you die.

783
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:05,160
Trust me.

784
01:15:05,195 --> 01:15:06,195
Let me see?

785
01:15:10,683 --> 01:15:12,340
Yeah!

786
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,374
Fuck yeah!

787
01:15:15,585 --> 01:15:18,346
FUCK YEAH!

788
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:23,281
Luke,

789
01:15:24,076 --> 01:15:25,076
Luke

790
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:30,081
Luke.

791
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,094
- We're gonna ge the fuck out
here.

792
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:50,171
Fuck. Ivanna.

793
01:15:55,866 --> 01:15:56,902
OOOOOOOOuchhh!

794
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:11,157
- Sophie? Katia? Whoever the
fuck you are,

795
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,745
you are a fucking cunt!

796
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,782
You think you are upset?

797
01:16:15,748 --> 01:16:18,095
I wanna wipe that look
off your face, mate,

798
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:22,099
however you die here, you
are going to stay that way.

799
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:31,074
- Shit! Fuck!

800
01:16:58,411 --> 01:16:59,412
- Well done!

801
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:01,932
Well done indeed!

802
01:17:03,969 --> 01:17:06,247
I like the power of death.

803
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:10,009
It's effective, efficiante
and most of all,

804
01:17:10,044 --> 01:17:11,044
it's entertaining.

805
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:15,152
Honestly, I didn't
think you had it in you.

806
01:17:15,187 --> 01:17:16,360
Bravo!

807
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:18,397
- You son of a bitch! What have
you done?

808
01:17:18,431 --> 01:17:22,056
- Just fulfilling my end
of a clandestine contract.

809
01:17:25,991 --> 01:17:29,442
No wheelchair needed here
in the Quantum Realm.

810
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:31,478
- Fuck?

811
01:17:32,307 --> 01:17:33,307
This...

812
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:36,346
I get it!

813
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,797
- What, you thought you could
win?

814
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:43,698
My dear boy, it's not
about winning or losing.

815
01:17:44,906 --> 01:17:46,943
It's much too deep for you to
comprehend.

816
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,153
- No, NO!

817
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:52,476
You're not going to
fuck with me head Cerno.

818
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,500
I'm here.

819
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:55,536
I'm here.

820
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,954
And you're going to pay.

821
01:17:59,265 --> 01:18:01,440
- Somehow I don't think so.

822
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:06,169
Here, my friend, reality is
fluid.

823
01:18:08,827 --> 01:18:11,105
Whatever you think, therefore
you are.

824
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:15,212
Of course I have been doing
most of your thinking for you.

825
01:18:15,247 --> 01:18:17,214
- Once you crossed into this
dimension,

826
01:18:18,146 --> 01:18:23,151
I used Sophie's psychic link
to manifest this environment.

827
01:18:23,186 --> 01:18:25,257
- You think I don't get the
simulacrum?

828
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:26,291
Me?

829
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,503
You think that makes you smart,
Cernovich?

830
01:18:30,538 --> 01:18:33,403
- Your combined memories and
perception of this building

831
01:18:33,437 --> 01:18:37,131
manifested here in this
dimension,

832
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:40,168
all from your own minds.

833
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,171
Incredible thing to see.

834
01:18:44,517 --> 01:18:47,072
With a few tweaks of my own.

835
01:18:48,142 --> 01:18:50,178
- That's right baby!

836
01:18:50,213 --> 01:18:53,975
Now we'll be here, together here
forever.

837
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,494
Yeah.

838
01:18:56,391 --> 01:18:57,910
- No! No, no, no!

839
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:03,744
- It is quite fascinating.

840
01:19:04,883 --> 01:19:07,851
Each of you, even you,

841
01:19:09,404 --> 01:19:12,891
clinging you minds to the
reality once accupied.

842
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,343
If you only knew what was
possible here?

843
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,207
I can make it permanent.

844
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,212
Something you can't possibly
understand.

845
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:30,909
Check and mate, Luke.

846
01:19:31,841 --> 01:19:34,222
- Luke, you still have a
chance. Get to the lab.

847
01:19:34,257 --> 01:19:35,465
- Yeah she's right.

848
01:19:35,499 --> 01:19:38,813
If you can get back to our
dimension without dying here.

849
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:54,415
You're all feeble earth
dwellers.

850
01:19:55,623 --> 01:19:57,349
Enjoy your fate.

851
01:20:47,019 --> 01:20:48,434
This is impossible.

852
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,403
- Bullocks! Didn't he see that
one coming.

853
01:20:52,542 --> 01:20:56,028
- I am afraid I can not
allow you to go back, Luke.

854
01:20:56,063 --> 01:20:57,063
- What?

855
01:20:58,203 --> 01:21:01,896
- I currently serve a master
with very a specific appetite.

856
01:21:03,173 --> 01:21:05,037
You are a very sick person,
Luke.

857
01:21:06,004 --> 01:21:09,076
Those pleasures, those wicked
delights,

858
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:11,630
they leave a stain on your soul.

859
01:21:12,596 --> 01:21:15,599
One my master finds quite
delectable.

860
01:21:15,634 --> 01:21:17,878
- What in the fuck are you
talking about?

861
01:21:26,058 --> 01:21:27,888
- There is power in the blood.

862
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:33,065
Blood, lust, sacrifice,
betrayal, murder...

863
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,481
Each one of you sinners.

864
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,932
You gave it all up for the
flesh.

865
01:21:39,002 --> 01:21:40,210
You have no protection.

866
01:21:41,246 --> 01:21:43,558
So now, once you're dead,

867
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,562
are just like food for
the master of this realm.

868
01:21:48,978 --> 01:21:50,255
Our Glorious One.

869
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:54,259
These Quantum Devils,

870
01:21:55,225 --> 01:21:56,225
if you will.

871
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,507
I will leave you to your
devices.

872
01:22:08,135 --> 01:22:10,654
I hope you find the house to
your liking,

873
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:13,416
because you are going to be
here for a very long time.

874
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:16,039
- No, I'm not dead!

875
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:18,109
Not yet!

876
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:23,736
Not if I kill you first!

877
01:22:26,015 --> 01:22:27,015
- I see.

878
01:22:29,259 --> 01:22:31,468
Are you challenging me to a
duel?

879
01:22:31,503 --> 01:22:33,712
- I am going to fuck you up,
asshole!

880
01:22:33,746 --> 01:22:35,748
- Well, I will take that as a
yes!

881
01:22:36,749 --> 01:22:38,096
Challenge accepted!

882
01:22:45,724 --> 01:22:46,725
- Gentlemen.

883
01:22:48,313 --> 01:22:50,522
- My dear fellow, I insist.

884
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,810
- Gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire,

885
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:05,192
I will toss a coin in the air.

886
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:09,334
As the offended party,

887
01:23:09,368 --> 01:23:11,577
it is Mr. Matthews's
choice to call the toss.

888
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,372
Is that agreeable to both of
you?

889
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:17,066
What is your call, Mr. Matthews?

890
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:19,584
- Heads.

891
01:23:24,107 --> 01:23:25,453
- It is heads.

892
01:23:25,488 --> 01:23:28,146
Mr. Matthews will have the first
fire.

893
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,389
Gentlemen, take your ground.

894
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,634
One...

895
01:23:35,429 --> 01:23:36,740
two...

896
01:23:36,775 --> 01:23:38,328
three...

897
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:39,536
four...

898
01:23:39,571 --> 01:23:40,779
five...

899
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:42,229
six...

900
01:23:42,263 --> 01:23:43,506
seven...

901
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,783
eight...

902
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:46,267
nine...

903
01:23:46,302 --> 01:23:47,302
ten.

904
01:23:48,373 --> 01:23:52,239
Lord Cerno, are you ready to
receive Mr. Matthews fire?

905
01:23:52,273 --> 01:23:53,273
- Always!

906
01:23:54,448 --> 01:23:56,829
- Mr. Matthews cock your pistol.

907
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:08,220
- What a shame.

908
01:24:08,255 --> 01:24:10,429
His pistol must be faulty.

909
01:24:10,464 --> 01:24:12,569
- No! No! I need another one.

910
01:24:12,604 --> 01:24:13,846
- I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews,

911
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,848
but you must first stand your
ground,

912
01:24:15,883 --> 01:24:18,368
and allow Lord Cerno his turn to
fire.

913
01:24:18,403 --> 01:24:21,544
Mr. Matthews, are you ready
to receive Lord Cerno's fire?

914
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:23,132
- No, you gave me a bad gun.

915
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:24,581
- You both had equal choice.

916
01:24:24,616 --> 01:24:26,652
Is your pistol cocked, Lord
Cerno?

917
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,275
Yes.

918
01:24:28,309 --> 01:24:30,104
- Then prepare to fire.

919
01:24:50,504 --> 01:24:52,713
Fuck. You fucking liar!

920
01:24:55,612 --> 01:24:59,651
I can't believe this,
this is not possible!

921
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:01,722
- You keep saying that?

922
01:25:01,756 --> 01:25:04,932
I can tell you one thing that
is certain, Mr. Matthews.

923
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:09,385
Here in the quantum realm,
reality is a lot like your
faith.

924
01:25:10,489 --> 01:25:13,423
It is only as real as you
believe it is.

925
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:16,426
Unless of course I make it real.

926
01:25:17,634 --> 01:25:19,774
And that is the key.

927
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:26,919
You lack conviction,
you're weak, Mr. Matthews.

928
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:00,608
- Barada! What an entrance!

929
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:03,335
Sic semper tyrannis!

930
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:07,857
- Enough of the useless
banter Huuuuummman!

931
01:26:09,928 --> 01:26:12,379
- Let's get down to
it, shall we, old chap?

932
01:26:12,413 --> 01:26:15,658
As you know I have fulfilled
my part of our contract.

933
01:26:15,692 --> 01:26:20,663
- I'm afraid I must alter our
agreement.

934
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:23,631
- We have a deal, no?

935
01:26:24,874 --> 01:26:26,807
- Not if you are dead.

936
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,917
- What is this?

937
01:26:35,678 --> 01:26:36,541
WHAT IS THIS!!

938
01:26:36,575 --> 01:26:39,889
- You see, I am a quick study,
Barada.

939
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:45,377
- Knowledge does not make
you a god, talking monkey.

940
01:26:45,412 --> 01:26:49,623
- No, being a god makes me a
god!

941
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:55,594
Now about our agreement.

942
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,978
- Enough parlor tricks,
Professor!

943
01:27:00,012 --> 01:27:02,774
- You should consider the future
Barada.

944
01:27:02,808 --> 01:27:06,260
Once I rule this realm I will
restructure its hierarchy.

945
01:27:12,473 --> 01:27:15,442
- Do you think you are the
first?

946
01:27:15,476 --> 01:27:18,962
- Of course not, but I will be
the last.

947
01:27:24,899 --> 01:27:25,969
- Very well, human!

948
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:32,321
I declare our contract is
fulfilled.

949
01:27:32,355 --> 01:27:33,563
QUANTUM MERUIT.

950
01:27:35,393 --> 01:27:37,464
- Now, my payment.

951
01:27:38,568 --> 01:27:39,568
Tell me.

952
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:43,435
- And nothing less. It must end.

953
01:27:44,609 --> 01:27:45,886
- Done.

954
01:27:58,450 --> 01:27:59,450
- Yes!

955
01:28:23,648 --> 01:28:26,029
- Heavenly Klaatu, simply
heavenly.

956
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:34,797
- Are we happy boss?

957
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:38,007
Yes Klaatu, yes indeed.

958
01:29:10,764 --> 01:29:12,490
- Keep it close, Klaatu.

959
01:29:12,524 --> 01:29:14,699
I have no idea how long this
will last.

960
01:29:15,562 --> 01:29:18,012
Any word from our headquarters?

961
01:29:18,047 --> 01:29:19,047
- Nothing.

962
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,444
- Sir, we have TEXAS on
the sat phone for you.

963
01:29:25,468 --> 01:29:27,367
- I'll take it in the car, thank
you.

964
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:32,094
- Sir

965
01:29:39,102 --> 01:29:40,172
- Hello?

966
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:41,207
Heinrich?

967
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:43,243
Heinrich?

968
01:29:44,522 --> 01:29:46,558
Heinrich, take off
those ridiculous goggles

969
01:29:46,593 --> 01:29:47,811
and look at me when I talk to
you.

970
01:29:47,835 --> 01:29:49,492
- Yes, Father, sorry.

971
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:52,737
I'm fine.

972
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:54,186
How is it there?

973
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:57,673
- Unlike what I am hearing from
Texas,

974
01:29:57,707 --> 01:30:00,158
this experiment was a rousing
success.

975
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:04,714
- And what of the inhabitants
of that dimension?

976
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:06,544
The old dead gods.

977
01:30:06,578 --> 01:30:08,615
- They are of no concern.

978
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:12,204
As long as we use the Quantum
Tanks, they can not touch us.

979
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:13,861
- I'm not quite that far along.

980
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:16,554
There are variables.

981
01:30:16,588 --> 01:30:19,039
They are trying to stop me.

982
01:30:19,073 --> 01:30:21,075
- Mind your indulgences.

983
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,048
- Destination sir?

984
01:30:28,082 --> 01:30:29,152
- The airport, Larry.

985
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:48,068
- Chop, chop.

986
01:30:48,102 --> 01:30:49,102
Yes sir.
