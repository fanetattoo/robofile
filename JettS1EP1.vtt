nail guns on his competition?

Sweeney:
I know what you are, so...

13:34.247 --> 13:36.289

get it off your chest.

13:36.373 --> 13:38.790

-I got a plane to catch,

13:38.873 --> 13:41.289

this up, officer.

13:41.373 --> 13:43.956

Tell me what happened.

about Lafayette.

Blair, and me.

with a known felon, Detective?

16:30.915 --> 16:33.539
She knew who I was

writers get hired

43:21.956 --> 43:24.331

-...never get made,

a lucrative career doing that.
